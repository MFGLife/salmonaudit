      title: "Motion for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, with Notice of Anticipated Class Certification Following Discovery",
      date: "2025-04-22",
      type: "Motion",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `COMES NOW Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon (“Plaintiff”), pursuant to K.S.A. § 60-223 and
    Rule 23 of the Kansas Rules of Civil Procedure, and respectfully moves this Court to certify this
    matter as a class action and grant declaratory and injunctive relief as follows:
    I. INTRODUCTION
    This action arises from the systematic, unauthorized, and procedurally unlawful conduct of The
    Layne Project, Inc.—a third-party entity repeatedly empowered by Kansas courts without
    adequate oversight, transparency, or legal foundation. The Layne Project acted without
    Plaintiff’s consent, outside judicial order, and against explicit, on-record objections. These
    actions caused measurable harm to Plaintiff and, based on extensive research and
    correspondence, a substantial number of similarly situated parents across Kansas.
    In addition, the involvement of outside actors, churches, and witness networks connected to
    court activity—specifically Christ Connect Church and individuals operating under religious or
    informal authority—has led to an expanded pattern of coordinated misconduct.
    This case addresses institutional collusion, witness manipulation, due process violations, and
    covert communication pipelines between unregulated entities and judicial actors—all shielded
    from public scrutiny.
    II. CLASS ACTION CRITERIA
    
    Page 1 of 7
    
    Plaintiff seeks certification on behalf of all persons within Kansas who, within the last five years:
    ● Were referred to The Layne Project for supervised visitation, parenting services, or
    custody-related evaluations without opportunity to formally object or without transparent
    documentation of referral;
    ● Were subjected to undisclosed, unilateral communication between The Layne Project
    and judicial actors without notice or consent;
    ● Were subjected to inconsistent and opaque financial practices that masked eligibility for
    fee waivers or falsely imposed financial obligations;
    ● Were subjected to non-governmental surveillance, uncredentialed observation, or
    informal church-backed “testimony” presented under the guise of moral authority;
    ● Suffered procedural, financial, and familial harm as a result of The Layne Project’s
    unauthorized role in judicial proceedings and its referral partnerships with informal
    institutions and personal contacts of the involved parties.
    
    The proposed class satisfies the requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and
    adequacy as detailed under K.S.A. § 60-223.
    III. STATEMENT OF FACTS
    A. Unauthorized Judicial Influence
    Without court order or Plaintiff’s consent, The Layne Project inserted itself into active litigation
    involving Plaintiff’s parental rights. It communicated directly with the court behind closed doors,
    influencing orders and recommendations while Plaintiff's timely objections were ignored or
    omitted from the record.
    B. Subpoena Stonewalled
    Plaintiff submitted multiple formal motions for subpoenas to uncover communications and
    procedural corruption tied to The Layne Project, Joshua Garrett, Kelly Truelove, and associated
    third parties. These requests remain unaddressed or delayed under vague procedural
    justifications, exposing systemic avoidance tactics.
    C. Collusion with Christ Connect Church and Improper Witness Behavior
    Members of Christ Connect Church, specifically Natasha and Robert Kluttz, submitted witness
    statements admitting to "monitoring" Plaintiff’s behavior without formal licensing or
    appointment. These statements were used in court to support claims of instability, while their
    association with referral relationships to The Layne Project remains undisclosed. Plaintiff’s
    own mother, Carolyn Salmon, has coordinated behind the scenes to support this narrative and
    facilitate church-based involvement in legal matters under the pretense of moral oversight.
    D. False Financial Barriers
    The Layne Project initially denied services absent full payment. Later, it was revealed—only after
    
    Page 2 of 7
    
    persistent inquiry—that fee waivers were available but withheld until arbitrary documentation
    was submitted. This misrepresentation directly interfered with Plaintiff’s right to visitation.
    E. Pattern of Obstruction
    Over a three-month period, The Layne Project refused to produce policies, communication
    records, or any documents related to their handling of Plaintiff’s case. Meanwhile, associated
    parties provided court with selective witness statements meant to simulate credibility while
    withholding context, personal connections, and conflicts of interest.
    IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF
    Plaintiff satisfies all criteria for class certification under K.S.A. § 60-223 and seeks equitable
    relief under Kansas civil procedure and constitutional doctrine. The harms in this case are not
    isolated—they are institutionalized, recurring, and designed to undermine due process through
    informal influence and procedural opacity.
    Numerosity: Hundreds of Kansas families are estimated to be affected annually.
    Commonality: Core legal issues arise from shared fact patterns.
    Typicality: Plaintiff’s experience mirrors that of many other victims of The Layne Project’s
    interference.
    Adequacy: Plaintiff has created a public-facing, transparent legal archive and audit system to
    ensure full class participation and documentation:
    V. RELIEF REQUESTED
    Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
    1. Certify this matter as a class action under K.S.A. § 60-223;
    2. Order The Layne Project and any associated institutions, including Christ Connect
    Church, to produce all communications related to case referrals, surveillance, witness
    coaching, or financial transactions;
    3. Declare that The Layne Project’s conduct, and the use of informal, uncredentialed
    witness participation coordinated through religious or private community institutions,
    violates Kansas due process protections;
    4. Enjoin The Layne Project and any partner institutions from participating in any legal
    matter involving Kansas families without:
    ○ Prior consent from both parties;
    ○ Transparent referral agreements;
    ○ Disclosure of all affiliations and conflicts;
    5. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper, including the preservation
    of whistleblower protection for future class members coming forward.

    NOTICE OF PATTERNED ENTERPRISE ACTIVITY INVOKING RICO
    STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
    COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully submits this
    supplemental motion in connection with the pending class action, to provide notice of the
    existence of a broader, structured pattern of misconduct consistent with the federal standards
    outlined in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§
    1961–1968.
    This supplemental notice is not a full RICO filing at this time but is provided for the Court’s
    awareness and possible future severance or referral to appropriate jurisdiction.
    I. BACKGROUND AND ENTERPRISE ELEMENTS
    Plaintiff has identified conduct across multiple actors which—when considered
    together—suggest the existence of a coordinated enterprise acting in a manner consistent with
    RICO's definition of an "association-in-fact" enterprise. This includes:
    ● The Layne Project, Inc., operating without transparency or oversight while coordinating
    ex parte with courts and family law attorneys;
    ● Crycella and Amanda Freitag, Stephanie Reed, Tyler Brown; police and court
    manipulation, kidnapping, perjury
    ● Joshua Garrett, attorney of record for the opposing party, shown to have direct referral
    and coordination ties with The Layne Project and non-legal actors;
    ● Natasha and Robert Kluttz, witnesses affiliated with Christ Connect Church, submitting
    extrajudicial surveillance testimony under religious or social cover;
    ● Carolyn Salmon, a close family member and silent actor whose role in facilitating
    improper contact, witness support, and moral framing remains ongoing and
    undocumented;
    ● Christ Connect Church, an entity which has maintained informal referral ties with Layne
    Project personnel and whose members act as unlicensed observers in custody cases.
    II. RICO RELEVANCE
    The structural, ongoing nature of these relationships satisfies the threshold for enterprise under
    RICO and introduces the possibility of:
    ● Witness tampering (18 U.S.C. § 1512)
    ● Obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503)
    ● Wire fraud via false affidavits and financial misrepresentations (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
    
    Page 4 of 7
    
    ● Extortion of parental rights via controlled access and manipulation of supervised
    visitation (18 U.S.C. § 1951)
    III. REQUEST FOR SEVERABLE RECOGNITION
    Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court acknowledge this supplemental filing as a stand-alone
    motion for future severance, referral, or expansion. This is not intended to alter the main class
    action framework but to preserve the record in anticipation of expanded relief being sought in
    either civil or federal court.
    WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Court:
    1. Accept this supplemental filing as judicial notice of an ongoing patterned enterprise;
    2. Permit severance of this issue if deemed prejudicial to the central class action matter;
    3. Allow discovery related to these individuals and entities to proceed under the RICO
    relevance standard;
    4. Provide any other relief the Court deems just and proper in light of this emergent
    structural pattern.
    
    MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PUBLICLY DISCLOSE SYSTEMIC
    CONFLICT NETWORKS
    COMES NOW Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court for a standing order
    requiring all named and involved entities—including public witnesses, court contractors, referral
    partners, and their associated religious or business organizations—to preserve and disclose any
    relationships that may constitute conflict of interest networks related to The Layne Project or
    custody-related case referrals over the last five (5) years.
    This motion also seeks judicial permission to maintain and publish a structured,
    non-confidential record of such networks for public and legal review under public accountability
    and transparency principles.
    I. BASIS FOR MOTION
    Plaintiff has uncovered and cataloged extensive overlap between personal, religious, and
    professional affiliations of parties testifying or influencing court activity, particularly:
    ● Church organizations (e.g., Christ Connect Church) submitting informal witness
    declarations tied to court influence;
    ● Undisclosed business relationships between said churches and The Layne Project;
    
    Page 5 of 7
    
    ● Personal coordination between witnesses (e.g., Natasha and Robert Kluttz), court
    officers, and therapists involved in custody assessments;
    ● Family-based suppression and triangulation, including the concealed role of Plaintiff’s
    mother, Carolyn Salmon, in guiding or manipulating narratives behind the scenes.
    II. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
    Plaintiff requests the Court:
    1. Order the preservation of communications and affiliations between witnesses, court
    officers, and religious or private organizations that have submitted information or had
    contact with this case;
    2. Permit the maintenance of a publicly viewable, evidence-based registry of witness
    affiliations and connections, which will be hosted at: https://salmonaudit.info/
    3. Recognize this preservation request as a proactive shield against future denial of
    coordination, tampering, or influence laundering across legal, social, and spiritual lines;
    4. Allow Plaintiff to continue organizing submissions from others affected by these referral
    and witness systems, as part of a broader pattern of court manipulation.
    III. WHY THIS MATTERS
    This motion is about prophylactic transparency. It gives the Court a choice:
    Either acknowledge the existence of improper relationships now,
    or face their exposure later—when it’s too late to act without consequence.
    If the parties involved have nothing to hide, they will comply.
    If not, their silence becomes evidentiary.
    WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an order compelling the above,
    and granting such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

  id: "2025CV325",
  title: "VERIFIED PETITION FOR DAMAGES, DISCOVERY, AND MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION",
  date: "2025-05-09",
  type: "Petition",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `This action arises out of a coordinated, sustained, and malicious campaign by private individuals and organizations to defame, isolate, and systemically harm the Plaintiff and other similarly situated parties through psychological coercion, false allegations, conspiratorial communications, and interference in familial, legal, and social relationships. The Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, brings this action both individually and in anticipation of certifying a broader class following discovery.
The currently named Defendants include individuals acting in both personal and professional capacities, with known communications among them indicating a shared agenda of parental alienation, reputational sabotage, and misuse of judicial and support systems. Discovery has been hindered by refusal to respond to formal inquiries, and substantial evidence is being actively concealed or deleted by Defendants. The conduct, if left unchecked, presents a pattern of modern coercive abuse enabled by unchecked familial and quasi-professional power structures.
I. JURISDICTION & VENUE
Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under K.S.A. § 60-308.
Venue is proper in Wyandotte County, Kansas, as the acts described occurred in this jurisdiction and involve ongoing harm to residents within this county, including the Plaintiff.
II. PARTIES
Plaintiff Micheal Lawrence Salmon is a resident of Wyandotte County, Kansas.
Defendant Trina Nudson is a caseworker and/or lawyer of The LANE Project, with whom Plaintiff has had multiple interactions concerning child welfare and legal disputes.
The LANE Project is believed to be operating under state-contracted authority and is named due to its enabling role in the conspiratorial and obstructive behavior described herein.
Defendants Carolyn Salmon, Chanille Dunn, Jesse Salmon, Crycella Freitag, Amanda Freitag, Christian Freitag, Stephanie Reed, and Nikki Kluttz are individuals with personal and/or professional ties to the Plaintiff and one another, who have engaged in coordinated conduct targeting Plaintiff.
Upon information and belief, communications among Defendants and with institutional actors reflect a collaborative effort to isolate, discredit, and harm the Plaintiff. Additional John and Jane Does will be named following discovery.
III. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff has documented a long-term pattern of harassment, defamation, interference, and control by the above-named individuals, resulting in loss of housing, child custody obstruction, reputational injury, and mental anguish.
Defendants have coordinated false narratives, weaponized third-party institutions (CPS, law enforcement, courts), and used digital platforms and social triangulation to isolate the Plaintiff from his child and support network.
Counsel representing Trina Nudson and/or The LANE Project has acknowledged discussions with Plaintiff regarding these matters but has failed to follow up or cooperate in good faith, further obstructing the Plaintiff's ability to gather evidence.
Plaintiff possesses over 80 gigabytes of audio, video, and document-based surveillance and data supporting the claims herein. However, critical digital evidence—particularly communications between Defendants—is known to be locked behind devices and cloud accounts requiring subpoena access. Plaintiff believes Defendants are actively deleting or concealing these records.
IV. CLASS FRAMEWORK AND DISCOVERY
Plaintiff brings this action individually and with the intention of moving to certify a class of similarly affected individuals following completion of discovery. The class is expected to include persons subjected to coercive familial abuse, malicious reporting, reputational sabotage, or child custody manipulation through networks of personal and institutional actors.
Plaintiff asserts that the conduct described is not isolated, but part of a growing pattern of coercive control enabled by overlapping personal and agency relationships that operate outside of judicial oversight.
Class certification is premature until digital communications and witness records can be obtained through formal discovery and forensic recovery. Plaintiff seeks judicial endorsement for a broad discovery plan and preservation order.
V. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
COUNT I – DEFAMATION
Defendants knowingly published and disseminated false statements about Plaintiff to third parties, including social services, courts, family members, and the general public, with malicious intent and without privilege.
COUNT II – COERCIVE CONTROL
Defendants employed systematic, psychological, and logistical strategies to isolate and dominate Plaintiff through manipulation of parental access, manufactured crises, and hostile third-party engagement.
COUNT III – CIVIL CONSPIRACY
Defendants entered into an agreement and/or understanding to engage in conduct calculated to harm Plaintiff and similarly situated individuals, evidenced through pattern behavior and known communications.
COUNT IV – TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE
Certain Defendants intentionally interfered with Plaintiff’s housing arrangements, landlord communications, custody rights, and employment prospects through dishonest and malicious acts.
VI. MEMORANDUM REGARDING PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION AND TRANSPARENCY
Petitioner hereby places this Court and all parties on notice that all proceedings, filings, and developments in this case will be publicly documented and archived for educational, safety, and transparency purposes. This documentation is fully protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as Kansas open records and public interest standards, and is being maintained in the interest of preserving an accurate historical record and ensuring accountability in a case involving significant civil rights and abuse allegations.
To the extent that any party or agent seeks to retaliate, suppress, or interfere with this documentation process, such actions will be treated as obstruction of justice, witness intimidation, or prior restraint, and appropriate motions will be filed immediately, including referrals to federal oversight and press freedom organizations if necessary.
This measure is not adversarial in nature but protective, due to demonstrated patterns of retaliation, dishonesty, and gaslighting by several of the named parties and affiliated institutions. Public visibility ensures safety and accuracy and is being pursued in good faith.
VII. MOTION TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE OF BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE FROM OLATHE POLICE DEPARTMENT
COMES NOW, Petitioner Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for an order compelling the immediate release of all body-worn camera footage, call logs, and incident reports from the Olathe Police Department involving interactions between the Department and the undersigned, or concerning Christ Connect Church, for the period covering the last six (6) months. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:
Relevant Background and Investigatory Activity
 Petitioner has been engaged in lawful private investigation into systemic coercive control, defamation, tortious interference, and coordinated abuse involving multiple named defendants who are closely and publicly affiliated with Christ Connect Church in Olathe, Kansas. Surveillance, statements, and social media evidence suggest an ongoing pattern of obstruction, conspiracy, and retaliation coordinated through said church and aided by improper shielding from accountability.
Police Involvement and Withheld Footage
 On or about [insert known incident date if available], Petitioner was approached by Olathe Police officers at or near Christ Connect Church. Officers claimed authority based on unverified allegations, yet no formal service, citation, or criminal charge was provided. Petitioner was told to vacate the premises under threat of trespass despite no legal grounds or notice. When a lawful subpoena for the related body cam footage and dashcam video was issued, the request was improperly denied on the grounds that it would “interfere with the church.”
Improper Invocation of Exemptions
 The refusal to release footage under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA) violates the statutory presumption in favor of transparency and amounts to obstruction of ongoing civil litigation. There is no applicable exemption that protects a religious organization from public accountability when its agents engage law enforcement to intimidate, mislead, or deter the exercise of legal rights.
Urgency and Spoliation Risk
 Due to ongoing concealment of evidence, credible reports of coordinated deletion of texts and documents by parties affiliated with Christ Connect Church, and the mobility of the defendants who appear to be fleeing service, there is immediate risk of spoliation. Delay in accessing the footage threatens irreparable harm to the integrity of discovery, and continued refusal may constitute deliberate obstruction.
Public Transparency and First Amendment Protections
 Petitioner asserts his First Amendment right to document and publish all proceedings, evidence, and government interactions related to this case. Any attempt to silence, intimidate, or deny access to public records—especially those used to protect or conceal civil wrongdoing—will be treated as obstruction and a violation of federal civil rights. The footage in question concerns a matter of broad public concern, including religious abuse of power, coordinated reputational harm, and systemic judicial interference.
VIII. MOTION FOR ALTERNATIVE SERVICE AND SERVICE BY PUBLICATION
COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pursuant to K.S.A. 60-307 and K.S.A. 60-313, and respectfully moves this Court to authorize alternative service and service by publication for the above-captioned action, and in support thereof states as follows:
Evidence of Evasion and Coordinated Obstruction
 Defendants are known to attend Christ Connect Church, a location where Plaintiff was unlawfully threatened with trespass by Olathe Police after attempting to effectuate lawful service. Despite no criminal action or citation, law enforcement refused to produce body cam footage under subpoena, citing protections for the church, thereby confirming deliberate obstruction and complicity in service evasion.
Known Social Media, Email, and Community Presence
 Plaintiff can confirm that Defendants maintain active accounts on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, and that their activities continue publicly through local employment, religious affiliation, and family networks in Wyandotte County and surrounding areas. Multiple parties have been seen vacationing, suggesting they are actively avoiding jurisdiction.
Proposed Alternative Methods
 Plaintiff now seeks authorization to serve Defendants through the following means, all of which are reasonably calculated to provide actual notice:


Direct message on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn
Emails to last known addresses
Public notice in the Wyandotte Daily News, KCUR classifieds, and Google Ads (geofenced to Wyandotte County)
Posting flyers near Christ Connect Church and their last known residences
Publishing the petition and summons on a public case-tracking website hosted by the Plaintiff
Paid social media advertising tagged to known associates


Legal Basis and Precedent
 Under K.S.A. 60-307 and Rule 4(e), courts may approve alternative service where personal service is impracticable, and publication under K.S.A. 60-313 is appropriate when residence is unknown or evaded. Given the deliberate efforts to obstruct, Plaintiff's request meets all statutory requirements.
IX. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
Accept this Petition for filing and permit full discovery under K.S.A. §§ 60-226 to 60-245;
Issue subpoenas to preserve and obtain digital communications between Defendants;
Order Defendants and their counsel to respond to prior communications regarding these claims or face sanctions;
Permit Plaintiff to amend the Petition post-discovery for formal class certification under K.S.A. § 60-223;
Order the immediate release of all body-worn and dash camera footage from the Olathe Police Department involving Christ Connect Church and Micheal Lawrence Salmon for the past six (6) months,
Compel the production of any call logs, written reports, or internal communications referencing said incidents,
Approve alternative service by the methods listed above, Consider service complete upon Plaintiff filing an affidavit detailing efforts and publication reach;
And grant any other relief this Court deems just and proper.`

  type: "Motion",
  status: "Granted",
  content: `Comes now, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to compel the Clerk’s Office to fulfill its ministerial duties, pursuant to applicable state law and constitutional guarantees of access to the courts. In support of this Motion, I state the following:
On_______________ I personally appeared at the Clerk’s Office for the purpose of performing procedural tasks required in preparation for lawful discovery, including but not limited to:
Requesting a blank subpoena form;
Filing or timestamping of case documents;
Accessing or reviewing court records.
These procedural tools are not optional but are essential to the exercise of my due process rights as a pro se litigant preparing for hearings and conducting discovery.
I was either denied access, redirected without explanation, or coerced into using forms that are not legally required under Wyandotte County procedural rules or Supreme Court Rule 111, which allows for written pleadings.
As a result, I was forced to spend unnecessary time and labor navigating administrative obstruction, all of which is being documented for federal claims involving denial of access, obstruction of due process, and coercive policies applied unequally to self-represented litigants.
This Motion is submitted to preserve the record, request judicial intervention, and serve notice of damages incurred.

 Time Spent: ____________________
 Staff Involved (if known): ____________________
 Action Requested: _______________________________________________
 Outcome / Notes:

WHEREFORE, I respectfully request that the Court:
Issue an order compelling the Clerk’s Office to provide equal access to litigation tools;
Declare that forcing use of pre-selected forms, when proper motions are filed, is not supported by rule or statute;
Enter this Motion on the docket to preserve the timeline and financial harm incurred from ongoing obstruction, and refrain from further obfuscation.`

  type: "Motion",
  status: "Granted",
  content: `COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to compel the Civil Clerk’s Office of this District to fulfill its ministerial duty under K.S.A. 60-245 by issuing and signing subpoenas submitted in good faith for purposes of pretrial discovery. In support of this Motion, Plaintiff states as follows:
STATEMENT OF FACTS:
Plaintiff is a pro se party in the above-captioned civil case, properly filed and pending in Wyandotte County District Court.
On or about [insert date of visit], Plaintiff appeared in person at the Civil Clerk’s Office to request subpoenas duces tecum in connection with discovery efforts, pursuant to K.S.A. 60-245 and relevant Kansas Rules of Civil Procedure.
The Clerk’s Office declined or delayed issuance of said subpoenas, despite the fact that:
Plaintiff provided a valid case number (25CV325),
The subpoenas were properly formatted or requested for pro se use,
The Kansas Code does not require legal representation to access discovery tools
LEGAL BASIS:
Under K.S.A. 60-245, subpoenas may be issued “by the clerk under the seal of the court or by an attorney as an officer of the court.”
As a pro se litigant, Plaintiff is entitled to utilize the Clerk's signature and seal in place of an attorney’s.
The Clerk’s refusal to issue subpoenas obstructs Plaintiff’s access to evidence and impairs the discovery process, which is protected under the Due Process Clauses of the Kansas Constitution and the U.S. Constitution.
DEMAND:
Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
Issue an Order to the Clerk instructing them to issue, sign, and seal subpoenas upon request by a pro se litigant in an active civil case; Confirm that pro se parties are entitled to use subpoenas as authorized under Kansas law without further gatekeeping or unnecessary delays; Waive any ambiguity or non-statutory policy blocking discovery access for parties without counsel.
To deny the undersigned access to court-issued subpoenas is to deny meaningful participation in civil litigation. No statutory basis exists for such obstruction. Plaintiff therefore asks the Court to enforce its own rules and issue relief as outlined above.`

  id: "2025CV325",
  title: "MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PRODUCE SURVEILLANCE AND BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE",
  date: "2025-05-15",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and hereby moves this Court to preserve and compel production of all surveillance and law enforcement body camera footage from incidents occurring on May 14, 2025, during filing procedures in the above-captioned cases. This footage is critical to evaluating potential violations of civil rights, improper interference with lawful discovery activity, and possible abuse of authority by courthouse officials and law enforcement personnel.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 14, 2025, Movant lawfully appeared at the Wyandotte County courthouse to file and deliver subpoenas tied to lawful discovery under open litigation in three matters. Court clerks at the civil filings window refused to process standard subpoena filings without justification, withheld procedural forms, and issued contradictory directives in what appeared to be a coordinated obstruction.
When Movant asked for clarification on how to escalate the issue, the clerks summoned an armed sheriff's deputy to the scene. The deputy did not de-escalate but rather aggravated the situation, spoke over legal questions, and attempted to dismiss Movant from a public records window. Upon learning that his conduct and identity would be included in a records request, the officer visibly and audibly turned off his body-worn camera mid-incident.
Movant has reason to believe this was not an isolated event but part of a pattern of retaliatory obstruction toward litigants pursuing subpoena enforcement, civil rights claims, or other discovery unfavorable to courthouse personnel or their associates. These events raise serious concerns regarding the clerk’s impartiality and whether court personnel are enlisting law enforcement to intimidate or suppress legal access for disfavored parties.
LEGAL BASIS
Under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., all body-worn and security camera footage recorded in public spaces by public officials is subject to disclosure and preservation. Further, under the Kansas Judicial Code of Conduct and applicable civil rights protections, clerks and judicial officers may not engage in retaliatory obstruction of access to courts or use law enforcement to discourage legal activity protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
This Court retains both statutory and inherent authority to order immediate preservation of material evidence where misconduct may be involved, especially when state actors use administrative power to interfere with due process and discovery rights.
REQUESTED RELIEF
Movant respectfully requests:
That the Court issue an immediate preservation order for all audio, video, and surveillance footage from the Wyandotte County courthouse on May 14, 2025, covering the time period between 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM.
That this order include:
Courthouse security camera footage showing civil clerk interactions
All body camera footage worn by the sheriff deputy who interacted with Movant
Any internal courthouse communications logs, radio transmissions, or dispatch records relevant to the clerk's request for police presence
Any video/audio showing the moment the officer deactivated his body camera
That the Court compel the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office and courthouse security division to produce the unredacted footage either:
Directly to Movant;
To the Court for in-camera review; or
Under seal and subject to protective order if privacy concerns arise.
That the Court formally record this request in the docket of each related case to preserve procedural integrity and guard against evidence spoliation, especially given the ongoing pattern of retaliation against Movant for exercising protected legal actions.`

  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and hereby petitions this Court to compel the Civil Division and Special Actions Division of the Wyandotte County Courthouse to accept properly submitted subpoenas duces tecum, and to preserve all associated surveillance and law enforcement body camera footage tied to the obstruction and police removal of the Petitioner on May 16, 2025.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 16, 2025, Petitioner attempted to submit a subpoena duces tecum to the Civil and Special Actions Divisions. Clerks were unable to distinguish between a subpoena ad testificatum and a subpoena duces tecum, incorrectly asserting that only one form was available. Petitioner clarified the legal distinction, but clerks refused to accept the submission and directed him to the Self-Help Center, which also issued the wrong form. Upon Petitioner’s attempt to educate the clerks and assert his right to submit the correct form, courthouse staff called law enforcement to remove him. Petitioner remained calm, was the only person present in the room, and did not raise his voice. His removal from the courthouse constituted a retaliatory action against lawful court access and First Amendment-protected conduct.
LEGAL BASIS
The refusal to accept a valid subpoena duces tecum violates procedural due process, impedes discovery, and obstructs the court’s own administrative integrity. Under Kansas law and the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), the public has the right to access records and to file lawful legal instruments. The clerk’s ignorance of basic subpoena forms and subsequent retaliatory involvement of law enforcement to remove a peaceful pro se litigant constitutes an abuse of discretion and a chilling violation of constitutional rights.

REQUESTED RELIEF
That the Court issue an order compelling all relevant court divisions to accept subpoenas duces tecum properly formatted and submitted by the Petitioner.
That the Court issue an order preserving all surveillance footage and audio from the Civil and Special Actions Divisions on May 16, 2025 (8:00 AM – 1:00 PM).
That the Court issue an order compelling the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office to preserve and produce body camera footage of officers who interacted with the Petitioner on May 16, 2025.
That the Court document this event on the official record for all relevant case dockets to protect against future obstruction or retaliation.
That the Court admonish or require remedial training for court clerks involved in the incident to prevent recurrences.`

      type: "Motion",
      status: "OverRuled",
      content: `TO THE HONORABLE COURT:\r\nI, Micheal Salmon, appearing Pro Se, respectfully move this Court to transfer venue for this\r\ncase from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience\r\nof all parties and witnesses, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a).\r\n\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis motion seeks to transfer venue to the District of Kansas, where both parties currently\r\nreside, to reduce undue burdens on the parties and ensure efficient resolution of this matter.\r\nThe current venue in Missouri imposes significant logistical and financial challenges, making it\r\nimpractical for the parties and witnesses.\r\n\r\nII. Factual Background\r\n1. Parties� Residences:\r\n? I, Micheal Salmon, reside at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas, 66103.\r\n? The Plaintiff, Crycella Freitag, resides in Pomona, Kansas.\r\n2. Current Venue Impact:\r\n? The current venue in Missouri is over four hours away from both parties� homes,\r\nmaking travel difficult.\r\n3. Efforts to Cooperate:\r\n? I relocated from Missouri to Kansas to facilitate co-parenting and reduce travel\r\nburdens, moving within 40 minutes of the Plaintiff.\r\n\r\n4. Personal and Community Ties in Kansas:\r\n? Our two-year-old son, Felix, attends a Montessori school and is actively involved\r\nin community activities in Kansas, including church and friendships.\r\n\r\n? Both families reside in Kansas, making it a more practical location for witness\r\ntestimonies.\r\n\r\n5. Financial and Work Constraints:\r\n? As a full-time single father, taking time off work to travel four hours each way for\r\ncourt proceedings is unfeasible.\r\n? The Plaintiff also works full time, making a Missouri venue equally burdensome.\r\n\r\nIII. Legal Standard\r\nUnder 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a), this Court may transfer a case for the convenience of the parties\r\nand witnesses, and in the interest of justice. Factors to consider include:\r\n1. The convenience of the parties and witnesses;\r\n2. Access to sources of proof;\r\n3. The plaintiff�s choice of forum;\r\n4. Practical challenges of conducting the trial in the chosen forum;\r\n5. Local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\r\n\r\nIV. Argument\r\n1. Convenience of the Parties:\r\n? Both parties reside in Kansas and would face significant hardship traveling to\r\nMissouri for court appearances. Transferring the case to Kansas reduces\r\nlogistical burdens for both.\r\n2. Convenience of Witnesses:\r\n? Both parties� families and potential witnesses reside in Kansas, minimizing travel\r\nfor them and ensuring better participation.\r\n\r\n3. Access to Evidence:\r\n? Relevant evidence, such as Felix�s school records and community ties, is more\r\nreadily available in Kansas.\r\n\r\n4. Local Interest:\r\n? Kansas has a strong local interest in adjudicating this matter, as both parties and\r\ntheir child reside and participate in the Kansas community.\r\n\r\n5. Interest of Justice:\r\n\r\n? Transferring the case aligns with fairness, reduces financial and logistical\r\nhardships, and supports the co-parenting relationship.\r\n\r\nV. Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons stated, I, Micheal Salmon, respectfully request that this Court transfer venue of\r\nthis case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice\r\nand for the convenience of the parties and witnesses.`

      date: "2025-04-17",
      type: "Motion",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY CUSTODY AND EX PARTE RELIEF
    I. EMERGENCY BASIS
    1. Petitioner respectfully moves this Court to grant temporary sole legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon, age 2, on an emergency basis.
    2. The child is currently suffering from daily untreated allergic reactions, presenting in the form of coughing, congestion, and respiratory distress.
    3. The mother, Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, has refused to take Felix to an allergist or seek treatment, despite repeated symptoms and parental requests, constituting ongoing medical neglect.
    4. Crycella has demonstrated a pattern of abuse, interference, and contempt of court, including but not limited to:
    Attempting to abduct Felix in June 2024 and calling the police to enforce an unlawful relocation to Kansas, directly violating the court’s jurisdiction and parental agreements.
    Willfully destroying and interfering with Felix’s communication with Petitioner by refusing all contact, confiscating devices, and failing to honor phone time—despite Petitioner allowing Felix free and unrestricted access to a phone and tablet.
    Ignoring multiple court orders without consequence, including orders regarding custody, communication, and medical care, while the court has failed to act—raising serious concerns of racial bias and systemic neglect of due process.
    5. Crycella has also exposed Felix to unsanitary and unsafe living conditions (previously documented in filings and hearings), and cold weather without appropriate clothing or shelter, directly contributing to his respiratory symptoms and physical discomfort. These repeated actions reflect a proven and escalating disregard for Felix’s health, safety, and well-being. Petitioner believes immediate intervention is necessary to prevent further harm.
    II. JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT
    Felix has resided in Kansas for 25 out of the past 29 months.
    The Missouri court (Stone County Case No. 24SN-DR00104) has not issued a valid custody order.
    The Missouri judge, Matt Alan Selby, stated on the record, “It’s getting close to the six-month rule, and I’m planning on dismissing.”
    The Missouri court has also:
    Ignored timely emergency motions in violation of published Motion Day rules.
    Failed to appoint a functioning Guardian ad Litem; Brook Gipson was named but has never made contact, has no record on Missouri Case.net, and is believed to be a phantom appointee used to mislead Petitioner.
    Permitted the opposing counsel to misrepresent facts and stall proceedings, as documented via communication with Ozarks Law Firm and Rooney McBride & Smith.
    Petitioner has filed an appeal in Missouri, removing jurisdiction from the trial court. (Southern Court of Appeals Case No. SD38905)
    Missouri is therefore an inconvenient and improper forum, and Kansas is the child’s true home state under the UCCJEA.
    III. REQUESTED ORDERS
    Petitioner requests the following relief:
    Grant temporary sole legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon to Petitioner.
    Issue an Emergency Ex Parte Order barring the mother from removing Felix from Kansas without court permission.
    Grant temporary visitation to the mother: four (4) hours weekly, unsupervised.
    Issue an order prohibiting interference with Petitioner’s parenting time, communication, and ability to seek medical care.
    Set a hearing for full custody determination at the Court’s earliest availability.
    IV. RELEVANT CONDUCT & UNRESPONSIVE COURT
    The mother has weaponized legal processes to obstruct access to Felix, including refusal to comply with visitation facilitation efforts and false claims of housing instability that have since been disproven.
    The Missouri judge has repeatedly refused to hear or rule on emergency filings, even those supported by evidence of harm to the child.
    Additionally, the visitation facility KidCentric cited in court records appears to be a nonexistent or fraudulent entity, with no actual ability to provide services, further undermining court credibility.
    V. FRAUDULENT REPRESENTATIONS & LIABILITY NOTICE
    Petitioner will pursue discovery and subpoena in future filings to investigate whether the Guardian ad Litem appointment was fraudulent, and whether Rooney McBride & Smith and Ozarks Law Firm are complicit in fabricating court compliance.
    Petitioner believes the Missouri court is intentionally stalling until (May 2nd) to dismiss the case under false pretenses.
    This Court is now the only venue positioned to protect the child.
    VI. NOTICE OF PARALLEL ACTION AND RESERVED RIGHTS
    Petitioner has initiated this emergency action in Kansas and expressly reserves the right to use any evidence or proceedings from Missouri in this or future legal actions.
    No findings or dismissals from Missouri—especially those issued under appeal, by a biased court, or without jurisdiction—shall be used to prejudice this Kansas proceeding or to limit Petitioner’s rights.
    Missouri has no authority to interfere with Kansas jurisdiction, and Petitioner requests this Court formally acknowledge Kansas as the child’s proper legal forum.
    
    DESIGNATION OF NEXT FRIEND
    Comes now, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully enters this action as the natural father and Next Friend of Felix Day Salmon, a minor child, for the purpose of pursuing legal remedies and protections in his best interests.
    
    MOTION TO FILE ELECTRONICALLY
    In support of this Motion, Petitioner states as follows:
    The Kansas Supreme Court Rules permit electronic filing of pleadings by self-represented litigants where such systems are in place.
    The undersigned is a pro se litigant and has access to the necessary technology to file electronically.
    Electronic filing will promote judicial efficiency, reduce unnecessary delay, and ensure timely access to the court by all parties.
    WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order allowing him to file pleadings electronically in this matter, and for such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

      date: "2025-05-02",
      type: "Petition",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `PETITION FOR IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO MINOR CHILD AND REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY HEARING
    COMES NOW the Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, biological father of Felix Day Salmon, and respectfully requests this Court to immediately grant temporary custodial access and set an emergency hearing regarding the welfare of the minor child, Felix Day Salmon. Petitioner has been denied all contact with his son for over three months due to a combination of jurisdictional confusion and procedural failures in an out-of-state proceeding. The result has caused severe emotional harm to both father and child and continues to violate Petitioner’s fundamental parental rights.
    Petitioner respectfully recommends the Court schedule an immediate hearing to award him at least one month of uninterrupted custodial time as a temporary, make-up period for the extensive and unjustified denial of access. Following this, Petitioner requests a fair and full evidentiary hearing to address all matters properly under Kansas jurisdiction. At the previous Missouri hearing, the Petitioner voluntarily produced all financial records, communication logs, and phone data, while the opposing party produced no evidence and was not held to any reciprocal standard. The result was a lopsided proceeding in which no factual rebuttal was considered.
    This Court has both the authority and the responsibility to intervene in the best interests of the child and to correct the procedural imbalance that has thus far deprived both child and father of their right to maintain their familial bond.
    This Court has proper jurisdiction under K.S.A. § 23-37, as both the minor child, Felix Day Salmon, and both parents currently reside within the State of Kansas. Any temporary relocation to Missouri was both recent and not made in good faith, as Respondent had expressed her intention to return Felix to Stone County, Missouri just weeks before the six-month statutory residency mark, suggesting the move was strategic rather than child-centered. (See Audit #ex.35.6)
    Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, has formally removed himself from the Missouri docket and is requesting Kansas assume full jurisdiction over all matters concerning Felix’s welfare. This petition is filed in good faith and in accordance with Kansas law, seeking immediate and corrective relief after multiple procedural injustices in Missouri proceedings.
    Critically, Respondent Crycella Freitag made no mention of the ongoing and complete denial of access between Felix and his father in her latest filings, choosing instead to focus her efforts entirely on forum control and jurisdictional maneuvering. This demonstrates a clear attempt to evade scrutiny and obstruct the fair resolution of custody and parenting time, rather than prioritize Felix’s best interests.
    Petitioner affirms that this is the proper venue for addressing these matters and that an emergency hearing is both necessary and legally appropriate to prevent further emotional harm to the child and irreparable erosion of the parent-child relationship. A competent and impartial court acting in the best interests of the child would proceed as follows:
    Grant the Petitioner immediate make-up custodial time with Felix while the facts and evidence are properly reviewed;
    Schedule a neutral evidentiary hearing in Kansas.
    This structure provides both parties a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate what sole custody looks like under their care, with the child’s well-being as the central focus. No Guardian ad Litem is needed; the parties are prepared to present direct evidence. What is required now is judicial intervention that prioritizes equity, transparency, and the child’s right to family continuity—values this Petition brings before this Court.
    Attached to this Petition are complete, unedited recordings of the last three Missouri hearings for the Court’s reference. Petitioner requests access to the audio copies submitted by Respondent in order to verify their integrity, given a history of misrepresentation in the record.

  title: "MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PRODUCE SURVEILLANCE AND BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE",
  date: "2025-05-15",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and hereby moves this Court to preserve and compel production of all surveillance and law enforcement body camera footage from incidents occurring on May 14, 2025, during filing procedures in the above-captioned cases. This footage is critical to evaluating potential violations of civil rights, improper interference with lawful discovery activity, and possible abuse of authority by courthouse officials and law enforcement personnel.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 14, 2025, Movant lawfully appeared at the Wyandotte County courthouse to file and deliver subpoenas tied to lawful discovery under open litigation in three matters. Court clerks at the civil filings window refused to process standard subpoena filings without justification, withheld procedural forms, and issued contradictory directives in what appeared to be a coordinated obstruction.
When Movant asked for clarification on how to escalate the issue, the clerks summoned an armed sheriff's deputy to the scene. The deputy did not de-escalate but rather aggravated the situation, spoke over legal questions, and attempted to dismiss Movant from a public records window. Upon learning that his conduct and identity would be included in a records request, the officer visibly and audibly turned off his body-worn camera mid-incident.
Movant has reason to believe this was not an isolated event but part of a pattern of retaliatory obstruction toward litigants pursuing subpoena enforcement, civil rights claims, or other discovery unfavorable to courthouse personnel or their associates. These events raise serious concerns regarding the clerk’s impartiality and whether court personnel are enlisting law enforcement to intimidate or suppress legal access for disfavored parties.
LEGAL BASIS
Under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., all body-worn and security camera footage recorded in public spaces by public officials is subject to disclosure and preservation. Further, under the Kansas Judicial Code of Conduct and applicable civil rights protections, clerks and judicial officers may not engage in retaliatory obstruction of access to courts or use law enforcement to discourage legal activity protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
This Court retains both statutory and inherent authority to order immediate preservation of material evidence where misconduct may be involved, especially when state actors use administrative power to interfere with due process and discovery rights.
REQUESTED RELIEF
Movant respectfully requests:
That the Court issue an immediate preservation order for all audio, video, and surveillance footage from the Wyandotte County courthouse on May 14, 2025, covering the time period between 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM.
That this order include:
Courthouse security camera footage showing civil clerk interactions
All body camera footage worn by the sheriff deputy who interacted with Movant
Any internal courthouse communications logs, radio transmissions, or dispatch records relevant to the clerk's request for police presence
Any video/audio showing the moment the officer deactivated his body camera
That the Court compel the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office and courthouse security division to produce the unredacted footage either:
Directly to Movant;
To the Court for in-camera review; or
Under seal and subject to protective order if privacy concerns arise.
That the Court formally record this request in the docket of each related case to preserve procedural integrity and guard against evidence spoliation, especially given the ongoing pattern of retaliation against Movant for exercising protected legal actions.`

  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to compel the Clerk’s Office to fulfill its ministerial duties pursuant to applicable state law and constitutional guarantees of access to the courts. In support of this Motion, I state the following:
On May 16, 2025, I personally appeared at the Clerk’s Office for the purpose of performing procedural tasks required in preparation for lawful discovery, including but not limited to:
Requesting a blank subpoena form;
Filing or timestamping of case documents;
Accessing or reviewing court records.
These procedural tools are not optional but are essential to the exercise of my due process rights as a pro se litigant preparing for hearings and conducting discovery.
I was either denied access, redirected without explanation, or coerced into using forms that are not legally required under Wyandotte County procedural rules or Kansas Supreme Court Rule 111, which allows for written pleadings.
As a result, I was forced to spend unnecessary time and labor navigating administrative obstruction, all of which is being documented for potential federal claims involving denial of access, obstruction of due process, and coercive policies applied unequally to self-represented litigants.
This Motion is submitted to preserve the record, request judicial intervention, and serve notice of damages incurred.
 Time Spent: __1 hour__[Total: $600 @3hrs]

Issue an order compelling the Clerk’s Office to provide equal access to litigation tools;
Declare that forcing use of pre-selected forms, when proper motions are filed, is not supported by rule or statute;
Enter this Motion on the docket to preserve the timeline and financial harm incurred from ongoing obstruction, and refrain from further obfuscation.`

  content: `VERIFIED PETITION FOR EMERGENCY WRIT AND SANCTIONS
(Due Process Violations, Procedural Manipulation, and Request for Immediate Relief)
COMES NOW the Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for the immediate issuance of an Emergency Writ and Sanctions, on grounds of administrative tampering, judicial misconduct, denial of due process, and obstruction of fundamental access to justice. Petitioner seeks urgent relief to prevent further harm, and in support states the following:

I. PARTIES & JURISDICTION
Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, is the biological father of Felix Day Salmon (DOB: December 20, 2022), and resides at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, KS 66103.
Respondent is the biological mother of Felix and resides at 512 Madison Street, Pomona, KS 66076.
Venue and jurisdiction are proper in Wyandotte County, Kansas pursuant to K.S.A. 23-37,201, as this matter involves parental rights and both parties currently reside in the State of Kansas.

II. DETAILED SUMMARY OF PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES
On the morning of May 21, 2025, Petitioner proactively contacted court staff to verify whether the custody hearing in case 2025-DM781 was still scheduled to occur as planned.
A clerk confirmed that the hearing remained on the schedule. However, Petitioner discovered that the docket entry had been removed from the public-facing court records, creating confusion about its status.
Petitioner requested formal proof of this removal. Adrianne, a court clerk, subsequently provided a screenshot of the internal docket system, which confirmed that the hearing had been removed—contrary to prior assurances by Christina “Tina” Rockley, who explicitly indicated that the hearing would be reinstated.
Petitioner had anticipated this form of administrative sabotage and had preserved a detailed email record of prior confirmations and staff communications. Despite the removal, Petitioner appeared at the Zoom hearing to preserve his rights.
Upon joining the Zoom call, Petitioner attempted to address his custody petition. However, Judge Kathleen Lynch abruptly refused to proceed, citing a purported failure to file a “petition for jurisdiction.”
Petitioner objected on the record, asserting that all required documents had already been submitted in accordance with court rules. Rather than allowing further clarification or argument, Judge Lynch immediately terminated the hearing, cutting off the Zoom session and violating Petitioner’s First Amendment right to be heard and his constitutional right to procedural due process.
Within minutes of this abrupt termination, Petitioner submitted the required jurisdictional petition via both email and fax, and called the clerk’s office to confirm and document this emergency submission.
Simultaneously, Petitioner was required to attend a separate live hearing for a related eviction case (WY2025LM002787) involving co-conspirator Kelly Truelove.
During this hearing, Petitioner encountered additional irregularities:
An unfamiliar judge presided over the matter without any formal introduction or record of substitution.
The proceeding was rushed, suggesting either predetermined intent or an attempt to limit scrutiny.
Petitioner’s filed motions were entirely ignored and no record of their existence was acknowledged on the call.
Various unnamed agents were present, and all recording and first amendment protections were under threat of arrest from six (6) uniformed officers.
These parallel events establish a clear pattern of procedural manipulation, denial of access, and collusion among judicial officers and staff to suppress Petitioner’s lawful attempts to assert parental rights and defend his legal position.

III. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF
Petitioner’s rights to due process, access to courts, and a fair hearing are enshrined in the U.S. Constitution (Amendments I and XIV) and the Kansas Constitution (Bill of Rights §18).
The actions and omissions described above amount to intentional administrative sabotage, obstruction of justice, and judicial misconduct.
Under K.S.A. 60-1501 (Habeas Corpus) and 60-1507 (Post-Conviction Remedies), the Court has full authority to issue writs and impose sanctions in cases where parties are deprived of fundamental rights by unlawful court or government actions.
The failure to provide a public docket, the termination of hearing access without cause, and the refusal to acknowledge motions collectively violate the core tenets of procedural fairness, court transparency, and judicial accountability.

IV. REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY WRIT AND SANCTIONS
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the Court to:
A. Issue an Emergency Writ compelling the Court to restore Petitioner’s right to a meaningful custody hearing without further delay or administrative obstruction;
B. Reinstate all previously scheduled hearings, ensuring they occur on the record, are open to public observation, and are docketed transparently;
C. Direct the Clerk of the Court to produce a full and unredacted docket history, including all administrative alterations, removals, and technical edits since this case was filed;
D. Order all judicial officers and court personnel involved in the removal of Petitioner’s hearing and the interference with his legal access to show cause and justify their actions under oath;
E. Impose sanctions against any personnel or judicial officer found to have acted in bad faith or in violation of the Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct or court administrative policy;
F. Award temporary parenting time to Petitioner pending a full evidentiary hearing on the merits;
G. Grant any further relief this Court deems just, proper, and necessary to prevent continued harm and restore integrity to the proceedings.

V. VERIFICATION
I, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Kansas that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.`

The plaintiff stipulated that frytag vacated July 14th 2024 and that the plaintiff was seeking late fees of $325 for 14 days. She possessed the premises in the month of July. Defendant Solomon paid rent on time for August and September and failed to pay rent for October and November and incident occurred on October 11th, in which landlord called defendant salmon at 8:30 PM.  Concerning late payment of rent defendant Solomon texted landlord advising. He was upset for contacting him outside of normal business hours and wanted plaintiff to communicate by email from that point forward the following day.

Defendant salmon failed to provide evidence that plaintiff's conduct was of such a continuing nature as to breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment.  Defendant salmon was not constructively evicted from the premises as a result of the brief interaction and inappropriate contact of the plaintiff. The court finds for the plaintiff on the count of defendant salmon's counter claim, defendant salmon claims plaintiff committed defamation by calling him a loser and by using a racial slur. The court finds no evidence that the plaintiff used a racial slur after watching a video in which plaintiff claimed it contained audio of her using the slur.  The defendant failed to prove the elements of defamation and that he put on no evidence that the defamatory statement of a loser was published to a third party that the defendant was identified by a third party by the statement and the defendant failed to put on any evidence of damage to his reputation, the court.

       15 of the least reads owner will give 30 day written notice to vacate the property unit. There is no exception in the lease for unpaid rents. Concerning that provision, a court finds plaintive violated this provision of her own contract and that she gave de thunder 3 days' notice before filing her petition for rent and possession, and the trial was held 5 days prior to the end of the 30 day. Notice period provided in the lease. The court finds that plaintiff violated the notice to vacate provision of her own lease.  The plaintiff seeks past due rent for the amount of $1800 and late fees in the amount of $1600 plus attorney fees of $700. The court is not persuaded that page 3 of the lease, the page that provides for late fees. Admitted into evidence was included in the original lease. It is not signed initialed by the parties, nor does it appear in similar font size or even appear to be part of the same document.  Both defendants testified under oath. That page 3 was not included in the lease that they both sacked. Furthermore, the court finds the provision for late fees $100 for the 1st day and $25 for each day after to be unreasonable and shocks the conscience of the court and that the late fees for one month equals 90%. Of the monthly rental value amount under the lease, the court therefore denies the plaintiff's request for late fees.  The court awards plaintiff $1800 in rent and attorney fees in the amount of $629 for a total judgment of $2429 plus court costs against Michael Salman. Only it is ordered that plaintiff is entitled to possession of 128 Fritz way, France and West Missouri immediately. Plaintiff is awarded $2429 against defendant Michael salmon plus court costs.`

  title: "EMERGENCY MOTION TO ACCEPT PARTIAL RECORD AND PRESERVE PUBLIC ACCESS TO VERIFIED EVIDENCE",
  date: "2025-05-16",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `Procedural Posture and Introduction
COMES NOW, the Appellant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for an emergency order to accept a partial record on appeal pursuant to Missouri Rule 81.12(c), and to formally recognize SalmonAudit.info as the central, authenticated, and organized repository of evidentiary material, given the clerical obstruction currently threatening timely appellate review. In support thereof, Appellant states the following:
I. OBSTRUCTION AND DELAY BY LOWER COURT CLERKS
Appellant has submitted the full Legal File in compliance with Rule 81.12, including all relevant orders, motions, transcripts, and exhibits.
The Stone County Clerk’s Office and/or the appellate filing clerk has failed to specify which documents are “missing,” despite multiple requests for clarification. This ambiguity is interfering with Appellant’s ability to comply with appellate procedures.
This conduct constitutes intentional or reckless administrative obstruction in violation of Appellant’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The failure to properly identify alleged deficiencies—despite having had an opportunity to do so—appears designed to run out the clock and sabotage Appellant’s appellate deadline.
II. MOTION TO ACCEPT PARTIAL RECORD UNDER RULE 81.12(c)
In light of the clerical obstruction, Appellant moves that the Court immediately accept the filed Legal File as a partial record per Rule 81.12(c) so that the appeal may proceed uninterrupted.
Appellant will supplement any remaining portions of the record once the clerk provides the specific deficiencies in writing or the Court orders them to do so.
III. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF PUBLIC EVIDENTIARY RECORD
Appellant formally incorporates by reference the public evidence database available at https://SalmonAudit.info, which is properly archived, time-stamped, and organized to ensure transparency and legal verifiability.
All referenced video, transcripts, filings, and exhibits within the Legal File submitted on appeal are publicly hosted and available for independent verification. The database serves as an unaltered digital record maintained due to persistent obstruction by court staff.
Appellant requests this Court recognize SalmonAudit.info as a legally cognizable and admissible evidentiary resource in this appeal and any future proceedings, pursuant to principles of equity, judicial economy, and modern access-to-justice standards.
IV. REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Appellant respectfully requests the following:
That this Court immediately accept the submitted Legal File as a Partial Record on Appeal under Rule 81.12(c) and direct the appeal to proceed;
That this Court enter a protective ruling recognizing https://SalmonAudit.info as a centralized evidentiary index tied to the case record;
That this Court order the Stone County Clerk’s Office to specifically enumerate in writing any alleged deficiencies in the record within 48 hours, or be deemed to have waived objections;
That the clerical obstruction be referred to the Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges and/or the Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel if further violations continue;
Any other relief this Court deems just and proper to preserve Appellant’s rights and prevent further miscarriage of justice.

        status: "Granted",

      Anderson Law, LLC d/b/a Anderson & Associates
      1901 W 47th Place Ste 300
      Westwood, Kansas 66205
      Re: Kelly Truelove / Alleged Debt / Wrongful Conduct and Notice of Legal Action
      To Whom It May Concern:
      I am in receipt of your attempts to collect an alleged debt of $900 and evict me from 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas 66103 on behalf of your client, Kelly Truelove.
      I hereby formally respond and demand that your office take full account of material facts and damages prior to proceeding further, as your client's misconduct, retaliation, and ongoing harassment are well-documented and legally actionable.
      
      1. Background and Financial Calculations
      I have resided at 4120 Adams St since Nov 2024 under terms that were verbally agreed upon with Kelly Truelove and Jozef Hanratty, despite inconsistencies and their later refusal to formalize a written lease. My monthly payments have been consistent with the agreed-upon amount of $400 for one room.
      Total agreed monthly rent: $400
      Amount allegedly owed: $900
      Calculation:
       The alleged amount suggests partial non-payment over approximately 2 months; however, rent was placed in escrow due to unresolved disputes and maintenance issues directly caused by Kelly Truelove's negligence and conduct, detailed below.
      
      
      
      2. Behavioral Misconduct and Harassment
      Kelly Truelove and/or her agents have engaged in repeated acts that constitute harassment and constructive eviction tactics:
      Property Damage:
      Entry door paint was deliberately ruined without cause.
      Interior taping and alteration of property without consent.
      
      
      Harassment:
      Repeated knocking on my door at all hours, including late night and early morning, disrupting my peaceful enjoyment of the premises.
      
      
      Illegal Process Service Attempt:
      An individual acting as a process server attempted to force me to sign an unidentified document.
      When I declined to sign without time to review, the individual unlawfully snatched the document out of my hands and refused to leave a copy.
      Demand: I require a full copy of any and all documents attempted to be served and the identity of the process server.
      
      
      
      3. Broader Legal Context and Impending Litigation
      It must also be noted that Kelly Truelove’s misconduct is not isolated.
       She is a central figure in an ongoing civil rights class action lawsuit tied to:
      Perjury facilitation: Kelly Truelove knowingly supported and verified false testimony by Jozef Hanratty in a Missouri custody proceeding (Case No. 24SN-DR00104).
      Custody Interference: Her actions directly contributed to the wrongful separation of my son, Felix, from me for now over three (3) months, causing severe emotional and financial damages.
      Collusion with Public Officials: Evidence ties Kelly Truelove to inappropriate coordination with GAL Josh Garrett and other parties.
      
      
      Given the intertwined nature of her wrongful eviction actions, debt collection actions, and broader legal misconduct, all future interactions with your office regarding this matter will be preserved as evidence in both individual civil claims and class action proceedings currently being prepared.
      
      4. Formal Demands
      Provide a full, itemized ledger for the alleged $900 balance.
      Identify the name and licensing information of the process server involved.
      Provide an immediate copy of the document attempted to be served on me.
      Immediately cease all eviction efforts based on fraud and retaliation until these issues are fully resolved.
      
      
      Failure to comply will result in immediate counterclaims being filed for:
      Illegal debt collection practices (15 U.S.C. §1692 FDCPA violations)
      Wrongful eviction and constructive eviction
      Retaliatory eviction
      Civil conspiracy claims
      
      
      Additionally, a formal complaint will be lodged with the Kansas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division against both your office and your client for unethical practices if these issues are not immediately addressed.
      
      Kelly Truelove’s behavior — including harassment, retaliation, material property damage, and verification of perjury — places her at the center of significant and growing litigation.
       Any further action by your firm in support of her wrongdoing will be viewed not only as a continuation of this misconduct but as participation in it.
      Please govern yourselves accordingly.
      Sincerely,
      Micheal Lawrence Salmon

        date: "2025-05-02",
        type: "Motion",
        status: "Pending",
        content: `ANSWER AND COUNTER-MOTIONS TO PLAINTIFF’S PETITION FOR FORCIBLE DETAINER
      COMES NOW, Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and submits this Answer and the following counter-motions in response to Plaintiff Kelly Truelove’s Petition for Forcible Detainer. Defendant respectfully asserts that this filing is without merit, legally defective, and part of an ongoing pattern of retaliatory and conspiratorial legal abuse.
      
      ANSWER TO PETITION
      Defendant denies that Plaintiff has standing to bring this eviction action. Plaintiff has repeatedly disclaimed her status as landlord and referred Defendant to a third party, Jozef Hanratty, regarding all tenancy matters.
      Defendant denies that there exists a landlord-tenant relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant. No lease or rent agreement exists between the parties.
      Defendant denies that any rent is owed to Plaintiff, and asserts that any payments were made under duress or escrowed while Plaintiff refused to recognize her alleged landlord role.
      Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s filing is in bad faith and is part of a coordinated effort involving multiple parties, including Jozef Hanratty and Attorney Josh Garrett, to manufacture legal instability and disrupt ongoing custody litigation.
      Defendant asserts that the same claim was previously filed and dismissed on March 21, 2025, and that this renewed filing constitutes an abuse of process and retaliation.
      
      
      
      I. MOTION TO SUBMIT PRIOR EVICTION DISMISSAL TO ESTABLISH BAD FAITH AND CONSPIRACY
      On March 21, 2025, this Court dismissed a prior eviction action filed by Plaintiff against Defendant.
      That prior filing was cited by Attorney Josh Garrett in related custody proceedings as evidence of alleged instability.
      This current action, duplicative in nature and renewed without change in circumstances, constitutes retaliatory legal action in bad faith.
      Plaintiff’s denial of landlord status invalidates both the original and current filings, and suggests the eviction is being used as a tool of influence in unrelated proceedings.
      Relief Requested: Defendant requests that the Court enter the prior dismissal into the record and recognize this renewed filing as part of a coordinated abuse of process.
      
      II. MOTION FOR JURY TRIAL PURSUANT TO KANSAS LAW
      Defendant respectfully requests a jury trial on all factual disputes, specifically regarding:
      The alleged existence of a landlord-tenant relationship;
      The motivations behind Plaintiff’s filing;
      Whether the filing was done in bad faith or in retaliation.
      Relief Requested: Defendant requests a jury trial be granted to ensure an impartial determination of the facts.
      
      III. MOTION TO COMPEL IMMEDIATE DISCOVERY
      Defendant moves this Court to compel production of all communications (emails, texts, recordings) between:
      Plaintiff Kelly Truelove
      Jozef Hanratty
      Crycella Freitag
      Amanda, Edward, Chris, Christian Freitag (and anyone else in home)
      Carolyn Salmon
      Trina Nudson
      Natasha and Robert Kluttz
      Attorney Josh Garrett
      concerning Defendant’s housing, tenancy, or eviction, within thirty (30) days.
      These records are material to establishing the retaliatory and conspiratorial nature of this filing.
      
      IV. MOTION TO COMPEL EARLY DEPOSITIONS
      Defendant requests the Court to order depositions of:
      Kelly Truelove
      Jozef Hanratty
      prior to the eviction hearing to preserve testimony, determine standing, and expose potential perjury or coordination with outside parties.
      
      V. MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF STANDING
      Plaintiff has denied under multiple communications being the acting landlord.
      Plaintiff cannot retroactively claim landlord status for the purpose of filing eviction when she previously refused to formalize a lease or accept rent directly.
      Plaintiff’s contradictory statements and failure to comply with Kansas landlord-tenant procedures invalidate the legal basis of this filing.
      Relief Requested: Defendant requests dismissal of the case with prejudice for lack of standing and improper use of legal process.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      CONCLUSION & GENERAL RELIEF REQUESTED
      WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:
      Deny the Petition for Forcible Detainer;
      Accept evidence of the prior dismissal as proof of retaliatory litigation;
      Grant a jury trial;
      Compel discovery and early depositions;
      Dismiss the case for lack of standing; and
      Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.`

  content: `NOTICE AND DEMAND WITH CERTIFIED SERVICE
This forward accompanies a formal filing outlining a series of escalating civil rights violations that have occurred under your supervision. I am a pro se litigant who has been unlawfully denied the ability to file emergency motions, repeatedly obstructed by court staff, and forced to appear before a judge whose identity was concealed, operating under another judge’s nameplate. You declined to state your surname and delegated critical functions to your assistant, Christina Rockley, while refusing to hear motions already filed. The Court has also ignored my repeated requests for the court recording submitted by opposing counsel. These actions, combined with likely ex parte communications involving Josh Garrett, Anderson & Associates, and Kelly Truelove, have deprived me of fair process. I am requesting depositions of Hanratty and Truelove before any hearing, and I will not proceed without a jury trial. This Court is now on formal notice that I will escalate to federal court, judicial oversight bodies, and civil litigation if the misconduct and obstruction continue.

MOTION TO ADDRESS CLERK’S PROCEDURAL MISCONDUCT AND DUE PROCESS VIOLATION REGARDING EMERGENCY FILING ACCESS FOR PRO SE LITIGANTS
COMES NOW Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully submits this Answer and the following counter-motions in response to Plaintiff Kelly Truelove’s Petition for Forcible Detainer. This submission is further necessitated by the Court’s failure at the most recent hearing to review or address any motions on file, despite their timely submission and relevance. The Honorable Court explicitly stated, “I will not view motions today,” even though multiple motions—including those asserting lack of standing, bad faith, and retaliatory intent—had been filed well in advance. This omission constitutes a denial of meaningful access to judicial review and undermines Defendant’s ability to present a full and fair defense in a time-sensitive matter.
JUDICIAL SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATION
In the interest of judicial efficiency, Defendant respectfully provides this summary:
This is a second, nearly identical eviction case filed by Plaintiff and previously dismissed on March 21, 2025.
Plaintiff has disclaimed being the landlord; Defendant has no lease with Plaintiff.
New evidence is being sought via subpoena, now authorized, including phone records proving collusion with Jozef Hanratty.
Defendant has placed rent into escrow at $400/month, consistent with one-bedroom occupancy, due to Plaintiff’s direct role in removing minor child Felix from the premises.
All rent payments will be available for final disbursement upon judicial ruling, and no payments will be made directly to Plaintiff without legal determination of standing.
Recommended Judicial Action:
Recognize Plaintiff’s lack of legal standing and contradictory conduct;
Accept prior dismissal as evidence of pattern abuse;
Allow discovery to continue under subpoena powers to identify coordinating parties and prove malicious intent.
APPENDED MOTIONS
A. MOTION TO RECOGNIZE RETALIATORY PATTERN AND PRIOR DISMISSAL
Filed action is substantively identical to the March 21, 2025, dismissal. The Court is asked to enter that dismissal into this case as probative evidence of harassment and abuse of process.
B. MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF STANDING
Plaintiff has repeatedly disclaimed being the landlord. No contract exists, no rent has been accepted by her directly, and attempts to formalize such an agreement were rejected.
C. MOTION TO RECOGNIZE VALID ESCROW AND REDUCED RENT
Original rent of $800/month covered two rooms, including for minor child Felix. Since Plaintiff colluded to remove Felix from Defendant’s custody—now under investigation—Defendant will place $400/month into escrow until lawful standing is determined.
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS
Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, has made repeated, legally-grounded attempts to access emergency relief under K.S.A. 60-206(d) and Wyandotte County Local Rule 126(a). Despite clear statutory entitlement, Plaintiff has been persistently obstructed by court staff, who falsely claimed—on record—that “only attorneys can file emergency motions.” This deliberate misstatement violates Kansas Supreme Court rules and constitutes an unlawful barrier to court access.
In a further act of judicial misconduct, Plaintiff’s cases were consolidated and assigned to a judge whose name does not appear on the Wyandotte County District Court’s official judge roster. During a court appearance on May 7, 2025, this judge refused to give her full name and appeared under a nameplate that read the name of another judge. When asked, she only identified herself as “Katelyn.” In open court, it was apparent that all critical case management and decision-making functions were performed by her assistant, Christina Rockley, whose conduct has overstepped clerical boundaries and entered into quasi-judicial activity.
Both this judicial obfuscation and improper delegation undermine the integrity of the judicial process and make it impossible for Plaintiff to file judicial complaints, recusals, or appeals with adequate notice.
Further compounding the misconduct, the court has refused to respond to multiple formal requests for a copy of the court recording already submitted by opposing counsel Josh Garrett. Mr. Garrett’s submission of this recording—presumably as evidence—has been acknowledged by the court, yet Plaintiff has been denied reciprocal access to that very same record, despite multiple direct requests.
Plaintiff strongly believes that improper ex parte communications have taken place between the judge, court clerks, opposing counsel Josh Garrett, Anderson & Associates, and third-party participant Kelly Truelove. These actors have been subpoenaed, and any hearing conducted without first obtaining their sworn depositions will violate Plaintiff’s due process rights.

II. LEGAL STANDARD AND VIOLATIONS
A. Equal Access for Pro Se Litigants
Kansas Supreme Court Administrative Order 2020-PR-016 and Kansas Self-Help Rule 1.3 guarantee self-represented litigants the right to file emergency motions via in-person, fax, dropbox, or mail. No law or policy limits emergency relief to licensed attorneys. Staff who block access or provide knowingly false information violate Rule 1.3(3), which states:
“Court staff must not... (3) deny a member of the public access to the court by providing information court staff knows to be incorrect.”
This ongoing misconduct by Wyandotte County clerks is not a mistake—it is a pattern of civil rights violations under color of law.
B. Judicial Impropriety and Concealment
It is a constitutional violation to preside over a proceeding while refusing to disclose one's legal identity as a judge. The presence of a judge operating under another judge’s nameplate, declining to state her surname, and delegating judicial acts to an assistant is not merely unprofessional—it is unlawful. Such concealment undermines recusal rights, judicial oversight, and appellate integrity, and it obstructs the public’s right to a fair and transparent judiciary under Canons 1, 2, and 3 of the Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct.
C. Due Process, Ex Parte Influence, and Denial of Evidence
The court’s failure to produce the requested audio or video evidence already submitted by opposing counsel is a direct violation of Plaintiff’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and obstructs both trial preparation and evidentiary balance.
Coupled with the Plaintiff's denied access to file motions, these acts of obstruction demonstrate a systemic effort to sabotage Plaintiff’s ability to defend and present their case—particularly given that the underlying matters involve fundamental rights to parenthood and property.
D. Right to Jury Trial and Pre-Hearing Depositions
Plaintiff has an absolute right to a jury trial under both Kansas Constitution, Bill of Rights §5 and U.S. Const. Amend. VII. The continued scheduling of hearings without honoring Plaintiff’s non-waived jury demand is unlawful.
Moreover, Plaintiff will not proceed to hearing without first securing court-ordered depositions of Joseph Hanratty and Kelly Truelove, whose conduct and testimony are central to the underlying claims of collusion, coercive control, and due process violations.

III. RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiff demands the following relief:
Immediate identification and public disclosure of the presiding judge in this matter, including their appointment order, term of assignment, and justification for hearing both cases despite absence from the official public judicial roster;
Production of the full audio/video court recording previously submitted by Josh Garrett to the court, as Plaintiff has requested on multiple occasions;
An enforceable order prohibiting all clerks and staff from obstructing emergency filings by pro se litigants, in accordance with Supreme Court and local rules;
A declaration from the Court that all further hearings shall be jury proceedings only, and that no waiver of jury trial has been executed or implied by Plaintiff;
Court-ordered depositions of Joseph Hanratty and Kelly Truelove prior to any future hearing, and an enforceable stay of proceedings until those depositions are completed;
Notice that continued interference, concealment, or civil rights violations will trigger immediate escalation to federal court under 42 U.S.C. §1983, and complaints to the Kansas Commission on Judicial Conduct and Kansas Attorney General for investigation and enforcement;
Any further relief this Court deems just, including sanctions or contempt citations against individuals who have knowingly misrepresented law or interfered with Plaintiff’s constitutional rights.
IV. NOTICE OF INTENT TO ESCALATE AND RESERVATION OF RIGHTS
Plaintiff hereby places the Court and its officers on notice that continued denial of:
Access to records already submitted into evidence by opposing parties;
Access to emergency filings permitted under Kansas law;
A transparent, constitutionally appointed judge;
Jury trial protections;
Timely depositions of key witnesses;
will result in immediate filings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for deprivation of rights under color of law, as well as individual civil suits against all participating clerks and administrators for malicious administrative abuse and rights violations.
Plaintiff also reserves the right to file complaints with the Kansas Commission on Judicial Conduct, the Judicial Branch Office of Judicial Administration, the Kansas Bar, and relevant media channels.
The systemic nature of these obstructions will not be tolerated, and further denial will be treated as intentional misconduct.


CONCLUSION AND DEMAND FOR JUDICIAL COMPLIANCE
This Court has been repeatedly notified—through filings, in-hearing objections, and administrative inquiries—that the Defendant has not only been denied meaningful access to emergency relief but has been subjected to procedural obfuscation, refusal to docket or review timely motions, and intentional suppression of evidence. The Defendant has complied with all known procedural obligations while opposing parties have benefited from improper channels, ex parte communications, and administrative favoritism. These cumulative actions, compounded by the Court’s refusal to identify the presiding judge, failure to rule on pending motions, and refusal to release existing court recordings, constitute ongoing violations of Defendant’s civil and constitutional rights.
Accordingly, the Defendant demands that this Court take the following corrective actions without delay:
That the Petition for Forcible Detainer be denied outright due to procedural abuse and lack of standing;
That all pending and previously filed motions, submitted well before the last hearing and improperly ignored, be accepted and ruled upon in writing;
That the record reflect the prior case dismissal and cross-filing pattern as clear evidence of retaliatory abuse and bad faith;
That this matter proceed to a jury trial as demanded under constitutional and statutory rights governing civil disputes involving possession and alleged fraud;
That discovery be opened immediately, and the early depositions of Joseph Hanratty and Kelly Truelove be compelled and scheduled in advance of any evidentiary hearing;
That the case be dismissed or stayed unless and until proper judicial conduct and procedural integrity are restored, including a formal ruling on all filed motions;
That a hearing be set specifically to address the withheld court recording submitted by opposing counsel, which remains a crucial and requested item of record.
Failure to take these actions will be treated as a continued and willful deprivation of rights under color of law, for which federal remedies, judicial complaints, and civil litigation will proceed against all parties and clerks involved.
The integrity of the Court is no longer presumed; it must now be demonstrated.`

  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Plaintiff Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to continue or reschedule the currently set hearing in this matter due to an unavoidable and direct scheduling conflict with an emergency custody hearing regarding Plaintiff’s minor child, Felix, scheduled for the same date and time.
In support of this motion, Plaintiff states as follows:
Plaintiff is the biological parent in an urgent custody matter pending in Wyandotte County, Kansas under Case No. 25DM781, which is set for hearing on the same date and time as the above-captioned matter.
The custody matter involves urgent issues of access, coercive control, and the best interests of a minor child, and was scheduled by the presiding court without input from Plaintiff as to availability. The matter cannot be postponed without substantial harm to Plaintiff's rights and to the child involved.
Given the overlapping jurisdictional demands between Kansas and Missouri, and the Plaintiff’s pro se status, Plaintiff respectfully requests a continuance of no less than 10 days, with preference for a rescheduling after May 27, 2025, to allow proper attendance and preparation.
Plaintiff has acted diligently in attempting to resolve both matters within the scope of the law and in good faith, and seeks this continuance solely to preserve his right to meaningfully appear and defend in both cases.
This motion is not made for purposes of delay, but to avoid irreparable prejudice and the appearance of default in either jurisdiction.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court continue the currently scheduled hearing in this matter to a later date, and for such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

  title: "MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PRODUCE SURVEILLANCE AND BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE",
  date: "2025-05-15",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and hereby moves this Court to preserve and compel production of all surveillance and law enforcement body camera footage from incidents occurring on May 14, 2025, during filing procedures in the above-captioned cases. This footage is critical to evaluating potential violations of civil rights, improper interference with lawful discovery activity, and possible abuse of authority by courthouse officials and law enforcement personnel.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 14, 2025, Movant lawfully appeared at the Wyandotte County courthouse to file and deliver subpoenas tied to lawful discovery under open litigation in three matters. Court clerks at the civil filings window refused to process standard subpoena filings without justification, withheld procedural forms, and issued contradictory directives in what appeared to be a coordinated obstruction.
When Movant asked for clarification on how to escalate the issue, the clerks summoned an armed sheriff's deputy to the scene. The deputy did not de-escalate but rather aggravated the situation, spoke over legal questions, and attempted to dismiss Movant from a public records window. Upon learning that his conduct and identity would be included in a records request, the officer visibly and audibly turned off his body-worn camera mid-incident.
Movant has reason to believe this was not an isolated event but part of a pattern of retaliatory obstruction toward litigants pursuing subpoena enforcement, civil rights claims, or other discovery unfavorable to courthouse personnel or their associates. These events raise serious concerns regarding the clerk’s impartiality and whether court personnel are enlisting law enforcement to intimidate or suppress legal access for disfavored parties.
LEGAL BASIS
Under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., all body-worn and security camera footage recorded in public spaces by public officials is subject to disclosure and preservation. Further, under the Kansas Judicial Code of Conduct and applicable civil rights protections, clerks and judicial officers may not engage in retaliatory obstruction of access to courts or use law enforcement to discourage legal activity protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
This Court retains both statutory and inherent authority to order immediate preservation of material evidence where misconduct may be involved, especially when state actors use administrative power to interfere with due process and discovery rights.
REQUESTED RELIEF
Movant respectfully requests:
That the Court issue an immediate preservation order for all audio, video, and surveillance footage from the Wyandotte County courthouse on May 14, 2025, covering the time period between 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM.
That this order include:
Courthouse security camera footage showing civil clerk interactions
All body camera footage worn by the sheriff deputy who interacted with Movant
Any internal courthouse communications logs, radio transmissions, or dispatch records relevant to the clerk's request for police presence
Any video/audio showing the moment the officer deactivated his body camera
That the Court compel the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office and courthouse security division to produce the unredacted footage either:
Directly to Movant;
To the Court for in-camera review; or
Under seal and subject to protective order if privacy concerns arise.
That the Court formally record this request in the docket of each related case to preserve procedural integrity and guard against evidence spoliation, especially given the ongoing pattern of retaliation against Movant for exercising protected legal actions.`

  id: "WY2025LM002787",
  title: "PETITION TO PRESERVE CIVIL RIGHTS AND DUE PROCESS",
  date: "2025-05-16",
  type: "Petition",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `Procedural Posture and Introduction
Defendant Micheal Salmon, pro se, respectfully submits this reply in opposition to Plaintiff Kelly Truelove’s arguments against Defendant’s counter motions, which include a Motion to Submit Prior Eviction Dismissal, Motion for Jury Trial, Motion to Compel Immediate Discovery, Motion to Compel Early Depositions, and Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing (collectively, "Defendant’s Motions"). For the reasons stated below, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court grant all of Defendant’s Motions in their entirety.
I. Defendant’s Motions Are Procedurally Proper and Relevant
Plaintiff's assertion that Defendant's Motions improperly exceed the scope of an answer as governed by K.S.A. 61-2904 is incorrect. While the statute outlines the basic requirements of an answer, it does not preclude a defendant from simultaneously filing counter motions seeking specific relief. Defendant, though pro se, is attempting to navigate the legal process and raise pertinent issues for the Court’s consideration. Plaintiff’s argument that these motions are not pleadings and do not meet statutory requirements is a mischaracterization. These are clearly identified as "Motions" seeking specific actions from the Court. Defendant’s motion to admit a prior eviction dismissal has merit as it speaks to a pattern of behavior and potentially bad faith on the part of the Plaintiff in pursuing successive actions related to the same property. The prior case, while dismissed without prejudice due to Defendant Salmon not being a named party to the lease at that time, is relevant to the current dispute, especially if the Plaintiff was aware of Defendant’s occupancy. Plaintiff has not provided sufficient legal authority to definitively exclude this prior dismissal from consideration, particularly in light of potential issues of harassment or vexatious litigation.
II. Defendant Has a Right to a Jury Trial Due to Triable Issues of Fact
Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant has admitted there is no lease, contract, or express agreement, thereby eliminating all genuine fact issues, is a misrepresentation of Defendant’s position. Defendant disputes the Plaintiff’s claim of superior right to possession and believes there are factual issues regarding the nature of his occupancy and any implied agreements or understandings that may exist. These disputed facts necessitate a jury trial to determine the validity of Plaintiff’s claim.
Furthermore, while K.S.A. 61-3807 mandates a summary possession trial within 14 days, this does not automatically negate Defendant’s right to a jury trial if genuine issues of material fact exist. The statute aims for expediency but does not override constitutional or statutory rights to a jury trial in appropriate cases. Defendant’s request for a jury trial, if timely filed under K.S.A. 60-232, should be honored, and the Court has the discretion to manage its docket to accommodate both the need for a timely resolution and the Defendant’s right to a jury trial.
III. Discovery Motions Are Procedurally Sound and Necessary to Establish Facts
Plaintiff’s assertion that Defendant’s Motions to Compel Immediate Discovery and Early Depositions are procedurally defective is incorrect. Defendant is attempting to utilize the available discovery tools under Chapter 61 to ascertain the factual basis of Plaintiff’s claims and to prepare his defense. While formal service is required, the urgency of this matter, as highlighted by the summary nature of the proceedings, necessitates an expedited approach to discovery. Plaintiff’s reliance on strict procedural interpretations should not be used to shield relevant information from the Defendant.
Defendant’s occupancy, while not based on a formal lease with the Plaintiff, does not automatically render discovery requests irrelevant. The circumstances surrounding Defendant’s occupancy are precisely what need to be discovered. Plaintiff’s claim that these requests are prejudicial and would delay proceedings is speculative. Proper case management by the Court can mitigate any potential delays. Access to discovery is crucial for Defendant to understand Plaintiff’s claims, gather necessary evidence, and present a meaningful defense.
IV. Plaintiff Lacks Standing to Pursue This Specific Action Against Defendant
Plaintiff’s claim of standing based on ownership and alleged failure of "one or more Defendants" to comply with lease terms or vacate is insufficient to establish standing against Defendant Micheal Salmon specifically. Plaintiff admits that Defendant Salmon was not a named party to the lease referenced in the Petition (Petition ¶¶ 6–7). Therefore, the alleged damages stemming from a breach of that lease do not directly apply to Defendant Salmon. Plaintiff has not established a direct causal link between Defendant Salmon’s actions and the alleged injury based on the lease agreement.
Defendant Salmon’s admission that he has no lease or landlord-tenant relationship with the Plaintiff further underscores the lack of standing. Plaintiff cannot claim damages or a right to possession against Defendant Salmon based on a lease agreement to which he was not a party. Plaintiff must establish an independent basis for standing against Defendant Salmon, which has not been adequately pleaded or demonstrated.
V. Conclusion
This case cannot be viewed in isolation. The conflict originated when Jozef Hanratty and Crycella Freitag—who were involved in an undisclosed relationship—conspired to remove my son, Felix, from my custody without due process. During that custody litigation (24SN-DR00104), I was denied access to critical subpoenaed communications that would have exposed their perjury and collusion. That obstruction has emboldened the parties to continue lying and mistreating me in an effort to paint me as unstable and shield themselves from liability.
Subsequently, Josh Garrett, under oath, confirmed that Kelly Truelove had delegated her landlord authority to Jozef Hanratty—directly validating my position and confirming Hanratty’s perjury. Despite this, Ms. Truelove has now retained counsel and refuses all communication, even though I attempted resolution through mediation and placed $400/month rent in escrow. Her silence and evasion are strategic and retaliatory, directly affecting my ability to maintain a stable home in an ongoing custody case. I am requesting discovery not to delay this case, but to protect my constitutional right to due process and expose an ongoing coordinated effort to interfere with my parental rights.
Plaintiff’s arguments against Defendant’s Motions are procedurally rigid, legally unfounded, and factually misrepresentative of Defendant’s position. Defendant’s Motions are aimed at ensuring a fair and just adjudication of the matter, allowing for the presentation of relevant evidence and the exercise of his right to a jury trial on disputed factual issues.
NOTICE WITH CERTIFIED SERVICE
Micheal Salmon certifies that this motion is filed in good faith and with intent to preserve the integrity of the judicial process and constitutional rights afforded to all litigants.

  date: "2025-05-22",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s Petition for Forcible Detainer for lack of standing, bad faith, and retaliatory conduct. In support, Defendant states as follows:
I. PLAINTIFF LACKS STANDING TO EVICT
Plaintiff refused to act as landlord:
Plaintiff, Kelly Truelove, delegated all landlord responsibilities to a third party, Jozef Hanratty, who has since disappeared and is not a party to this action.
No valid landlord-tenant relationship:
Plaintiff never signed a lease with Defendant, never accepted rent directly, and never established mutual assent as required by K.S.A. § 58-2543(b) (“A rental agreement shall be enforceable only if there is mutual assent between landlord and tenant.”).
No continuous landlord authority:
Plaintiff cannot retroactively claim landlord status after abandoning her role. See Smith v. Marshall, 222 Kan. 91, 563 P.2d 1021 (1977) (“Landlord authority must be continuous and not subject to arbitrary withdrawal or reassignment.”).
Improper party:
Plaintiff’s petition fails to establish that she is the real party in interest, as required by K.S.A. § 60-217(a).
II. PLAINTIFF ENGAGED IN BAD FAITH AND RETALIATION
Failure to perform landlord duties:
Plaintiff refused to perform essential landlord duties, including repairs and lease formation, while demanding rent—violating K.S.A. § 58-2553 (landlord obligations).
Retaliatory eviction:
Plaintiff’s eviction filing is retaliatory under K.S.A. § 58-2572, as it follows Defendant’s involvement in related custody litigation against her associate, Crycella Freitag.
Harassment and constructive eviction:
Plaintiff engaged in coercive tactics, including harassment at all hours, taping doors, and property damage, in violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (K.S.A. § 58-2555).
Constructive eviction:
Plaintiff’s conduct forced Defendant to escrow rent and created an uninhabitable environment, amounting to constructive eviction.
III. PROCEDURAL ABUSE AND JUDICIAL NOTICE REQUESTED
Improper denial of standing challenge:
The Court improperly denied Defendant’s right to challenge Plaintiff’s standing, despite clear evidence of Plaintiff’s contradictory conduct—denying landlord status while seeking eviction.
Failure to address dispositive motions:
Defendant’s emergency motions, including requests for jury trial, discovery, and dismissal, have not been ruled on in writing, violating K.S.A. 60-252(a) and Supreme Court Rule 165.
Request for judicial notice:
Defendant requests the Court take judicial notice of:
Plaintiff’s prior refusal to act as landlord (see Exhibit A: emails and texts);
The March 21, 2025, dismissal of an identical eviction claim (Exhibit B);
The retaliatory pattern linked to custody case 2025DM781 (Exhibit C).
IV. REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS AND PRESERVATION OF OBJECTIONS
Request for written findings:
Pursuant to K.S.A. 60-252(a) and Kansas Supreme Court Rule 165, Defendant requests written findings of fact and conclusions of law on each pending motion, including this motion and all previously filed motions (see Supplement filed herewith).
Preservation of objections:
Defendant objects to any further proceedings until all dispositive motions are ruled on in writing and requests the record reflect this continuing objection for appellate purposes.
Due process violation:
The Court’s failure to rule on dispositive motions, including the request for jury trial, constitutes reversible error and a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Dismiss Plaintiff’s Petition for Forcible Detainer with prejudice for lack of standing, bad faith, and retaliatory conduct;
B. Impose sanctions against Plaintiff for abuse of process;
C. Take judicial notice of Plaintiff’s contradictory conduct and prior case history;
D. Issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law on this and all pending motions;
E. Preserve all objections for appellate review;
F. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

  title: "MOTION TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE OF ALL COURTROOM ATTENDEES AND THEIR ROLES",
  date: "2025-05-22",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to order the disclosure of the names, titles, and official roles of all persons present in the courtroom (physically or virtually) during the hearing held on May 21, 2025. In support, Defendant states as follows:
I. BACKGROUND
During the hearing on May 21, 2025, Defendant observed and noted the presence of multiple individuals whose roles and authority were not disclosed on the record.
Specifically, Defendant observed:
One individual in the witness chair who appeared to be a psychologist or mental health professional;
Two individuals who presented themselves as special agents or law enforcement investigators;
One individual acting as legal counsel (identity not confirmed on the record);
Six uniformed officers whose agency and purpose were not stated;
One individual presiding as judge whose credentials and authority are disputed by Defendant.
Defendant was not provided with a list of attendees or their official capacity, nor was there any explanation for the presence of certain individuals not typically required for a forcible detainer (eviction) hearing.
II. LEGAL BASIS
Defendant has a fundamental right to a fair and transparent proceeding under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 18 of the Kansas Bill of Rights.
Kansas Supreme Court Rule 1001 and K.S.A. 60-241 require that all proceedings be conducted openly and that the parties be informed of the identity and role of all persons participating in or observing the proceedings.
The presence of undisclosed law enforcement, mental health professionals, or other government agents raises serious concerns about the impartiality and integrity of the proceedings, and may constitute grounds for judicial disqualification or further legal action if not properly explained.
EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY STAY OF EVICTION AND PROTECTIVE ORDER
COMES NOW Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully requests this Court to enter a temporary stay of any eviction, removal, or enforcement action for a period of sixty (60) days, and to issue a protective order against further harassment or intimidation by Plaintiff or her agents. In support, Defendant states as follows:
I. BACKGROUND
Defendant is actively seeking alternative housing but requires additional time to secure safe and stable accommodations due to the ongoing legal disputes and the retaliatory nature of Plaintiff’s conduct.
Immediate eviction or removal would cause irreparable harm to Defendant, including potential homelessness, loss of property, and further exposure to harassment and intimidation.
II. LEGAL BASIS
Pursuant to K.S.A. 60-906 (Injunctions and Restraining Orders), the Court has authority to stay enforcement of any judgment or order where immediate action would cause irreparable harm or where the interests of justice so require.
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 18 of the Kansas Bill of Rights guarantee Defendant the right to be free from arbitrary deprivation of property and to have a meaningful opportunity to secure alternative housing.
Kansas courts have inherent authority to issue stays and protective orders to prevent harassment, intimidation, or retaliation during the pendency of legal proceedings. See K.S.A. 60-31a05 (Protection from Stalking or Harassment Act).
III. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:
A. Enter a temporary stay of any eviction, removal, or enforcement action for a period of sixty (60) days from the date of this motion, to allow Defendant time to secure alternative housing and protect his property and safety;
B. Issue a protective order prohibiting Plaintiff, her agents, or any third parties acting on her behalf from engaging in further harassment, intimidation, or disruptive conduct toward Defendant during this period;
C. Order that any further attempts at removal or harassment without court approval shall be deemed contempt of court and subject to sanctions;
D. Preserve Defendant’s objections and rights for appellate review;
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
F. Order the Clerk of Court and/or the presiding judge to provide a complete list of all individuals present at the May 21, 2025 hearing, including:
Full name,
Title or rank,
Agency or employer,
Official role or purpose for attending;
G. Require the Court to state on the record the necessity for the presence of each non-party or non-court staff member;
H. Preserve Defendant’s objections to the presence of any unauthorized or undisclosed individuals for appellate review;
I. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

  date: "2025-05-20",
  type: "Petition",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS
MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON,
Plaintiff,
v.
DA. MARK DUPREE, in his official and individual capacity as Wyandotte County District Attorney; JUDGE KLAPPER, in his official and individual capacity as Judge, Wyandotte County District Court; JUDGE SELBY, in his official and individual capacity as Judge, Stone County Circuit Court;
TINA ROCKLEY and other unidentified clerks, Wyandotte County Clerk’s Office;
MICHELLE LEBOW and other unidentified clerks, Stone County Clerk’s Office;
WYANDOTTE COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT;
OLATHE POLICE DEPARTMENT,
Defendants.

COMPLAINT FOR DEPRIVATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, PETITION FOR WRIT, AND MOTION FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF
(42 U.S.C. § 1983; All Writs Act; Due Process and Equal Protection Violations; Related State and Class Actions)

I. INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, brings this action to redress a coordinated campaign of civil rights violations, obstruction of justice, and deprivation of due process by judicial, law enforcement, and quasi-public actors in Kansas and Missouri. These violations have directly impaired Plaintiff’s right to access the courts, secure evidence, and protect the welfare of a minor child, and have obstructed class-wide relief in related state actions.
This Petition incorporates and supplements the factual and legal bases from the following related cases:
24SN-DR00104 (Missouri Stone County): Custody, due process, and judicial misconduct claims.
2025DM781 (Wyandotte County, Kansas): Felix Custody, denial of access, and procedural obstruction.
2025CV325 (Wyandotte County, Kansas): Salmon v. The Layne Project, et al.—class action for coercive control, defamation, and conspiracy.
Plaintiff alleges a pattern of administrative silence, intimidation, unlawful removal from court premises, and manipulation of dockets and evidence, all in violation of federal and state law.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1367 (federal question, civil rights, supplemental jurisdiction). Venue is proper in this District because the acts and omissions occurred within Kansas and affect parties and proceedings in this jurisdiction.

III. PARTIES
Plaintiff:
Micheal Lawrence Salmon, resident of Wyandotte County, Kansas, individually and on behalf of a proposed class of similarly situated individuals.
Defendants:
Mark Dupree, Wyandotte County District Attorney (official and individual capacity)
Judge Klapper, Wyandotte County District Court (official and individual capacity)
Tina Rockley and additional Wyandotte County clerks
Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department
Olathe Police Department

IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Obstruction and Retaliation:
Plaintiff issued multiple valid subpoenas in ongoing state and class actions. No compliance or response was received from Defendants, despite statutory obligations.
Plaintiff was physically and procedurally obstructed by Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department, including threats and denial of entry to court premises.
Judicial and clerical staff, including Judge Klapper and Tina Rockley, manipulated dockets, canceled hearings without notice, and enabled ex parte concealment of filings.
Cross-Jurisdictional Suppression:
Plaintiff’s filings and emergency motions in Missouri (24SN-DR00104) and Kansas (2025DM781, 2025CV325) were ignored, denied, or actively suppressed through coordinated administrative action.
Evidence suggests ex parte communications and coordinated efforts between Kansas and Missouri court staff to suppress Plaintiff’s access to relief.
Denial of Evidence and Transparency:
Olathe Police Department refused to release body camera and dashcam footage under subpoena, improperly invoking religious exemptions and obstructing ongoing litigation.
Defendants have actively deleted, concealed, or failed to preserve critical digital evidence, risking spoliation and irreparable harm to Plaintiff’s cases.
Class-Wide Harm:
In 2025CV325, Plaintiff and a proposed class allege a pattern of coercive control, defamation, and reputational sabotage by The Layne Project, Trina Nudson, and associated parties, enabled by institutional actors and law enforcement.

V. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
COUNT I – Violation of Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. § 1983):
Defendants, acting under color of state law, deprived Plaintiff and the proposed class of due process, equal protection, and access to the courts.
COUNT II – Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. § 1985):
Defendants conspired to obstruct justice, retaliate against whistleblowing, and suppress evidence and testimony.
COUNT III – Obstruction of Justice (All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651):
Defendants’ actions constitute ongoing obstruction, necessitating federal intervention and preservation orders.
COUNT IV – Declaratory and Injunctive Relief:
Plaintiff seeks immediate injunctive relief to preserve evidence, halt further retaliation, and compel compliance with subpoenas and court orders.

VI. EMERGENCY MOTIONS AND PRESERVATION REQUESTS
Notice of Civil Rights Action and Preservation of All Writs:
All Defendants are hereby notified of the pending federal action and are ordered to preserve all emails, notes, internal communications, case files, video recordings, bodycam footage, and clerk system records associated with the following cases:
24SN-DR00104 (Missouri Stone County)
2025DM781 (Wyandotte County, Kansas)
2025CV325 (Wyandotte County, Kansas)
Motion for Preliminary Injunction:
Plaintiff moves for an order restraining Defendants from further interference, retaliation, or destruction of evidence while this action is pending.
Motion to Compel Disclosure:
Plaintiff moves for immediate release of all body-worn and dash camera footage, call logs, and incident reports from the Olathe Police Department concerning Plaintiff or Christ Connect Church for the past six (6) months.
Motion for Alternative Service:
Plaintiff requests authorization to serve Defendants by alternative means, including digital notice, social media, publication, and public posting, due to demonstrated evasion and coordinated obstruction.

VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
Accept this Petition and Complaint for filing;
Issue a preservation order for all evidence, communications, and digital records relevant to the above-captioned and related state cases;
Grant a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from further retaliation, obstruction, or destruction of evidence;
Compel immediate production of subpoenaed records and footage;
Approve alternative service methods as detailed above;
Permit Plaintiff to amend and supplement this Petition post-discovery for class certification and further relief;
Award declaratory and monetary relief as appropriate;

  content: `Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, respectfully moves this Court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915, and in support states as follows:
Plaintiff is unable to pay the costs of these proceedings due to financial hardship. Plaintiff’s income is insufficient to cover the filing fee and necessary living expenses.
Plaintiff’s affidavit of financial status is submitted herewith, setting forth all sources of income, assets, and liabilities, as required by law.
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges ongoing violations of civil rights, due process, and access to the courts, as detailed in the accompanying complaint and emergency motions.
Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court grant this motion and allow this action to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs, and for such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays the Court grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and accept the complaint for filing without prepayment of the filing fee.


Statement of Financial Status in Support of Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis
I, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, submit this statement in support of my Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis:
Employment and Income:
I am currently employed full-time at SalmonAudit.info. However, due to the ongoing deprivation of my rights and the retaliatory actions described in my complaint, I have suffered significant financial hardship. My current income is insufficient to meet my basic needs and to pay the court’s filing fee.
Supplemental Work:
In addition to my primary employment, I perform part-time gig work, including food delivery for DoorDash. This supplemental work is necessary to cover essential expenses such as food and bills.
Financial Hardship:
These circumstances have persisted for approximately seven months. During this period, my ability to earn and maintain savings has been severely impacted. I am currently relying on my remaining savings, which are being rapidly depleted to cover basic living expenses.
Inability to Pay Filing Fee:
Given my current financial situation, I am unable to pay the $405 filing fee without sacrificing essential needs. I respectfully request that the Court grant my motion to proceed in forma pauperis so that I may pursue this action for damages and relief.

    content: `Comes now Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and states the following in response to Petitioner�s objections:\r\nSupervised visitation is unnecessary. The requirement was based on an unfair custody order that was issued on false premises. The underlying claims were dismissed without prejudice, and the order was imposed outside the proper jurisdiction.\r\nRespondent�s objections are contradictory. Respondent claims none of the proposed providers offer supervision, yet admits at least two do but dismisses them due to distance. This contradicts the argument that no viable options exist and demonstrates obstruction rather than cooperation.\r\nRespondent has continuously acted in bad faith to prevent my time with Felix. It has now been two months since I have been allowed to see my son, despite no valid legal justification for continued interference.\r\nWherefore, Respondent requests the Court immediately reinstate my parenting time and grant any further relief deemed just and proper.`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `I, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, as the Movant in the above-referenced case, formally submit this request for judicial review and immediate forwarding of this matter to the appellate court due to procedural irregularities and judicial obstruction that have severely impacted my ability to receive a fair and impartial hearing. In support of this request, I state the following:\r\nUnaddressed Critical Evidence\r\nThe only remaining evidence being used against me is an edited video that has yet to be ruled on by this Court. The refusal to make a determination on this evidence directly impacts the integrity of this case and my ability to properly defend myself.\r\nIgnored Emergency Motion for Charges\r\nI filed an Emergency Motion for Charges, and various Subpoenas requesting phone records to expose illegal conversations between Kelly Truelove, Jozef Hanratty, Josh Garrett, and Crycella Freitag. This motion remains ignored, despite its clear relevance in establishing collusion and perjury within these proceedings.\r\nJudicial Obstruction and Procedural Violations\r\nThe Court has consistently ignored my motions while granting those of the opposing party, allowing unchecked perjury, and failing to rule on critical evidence that would dismantle the basis for the custody determination.\r\nThe custody order itself is founded on documented collusion, conspiracy, and perjury�facts which this Court has been presented with repeatedly but refuses to address.\r\nAdditionally, the Court�s persistent refusal to allow me to properly present my case, prepare my arguments, and engage in meaningful hearings constitutes a severe violation of due process.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY MOTION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF PARENTING TIME, CONTEMPT, AND IMMEDIATE RELIEF\r\n1. Background\r\n1.1. This Court previously entered an order granting Movant specific parenting time, including scheduled in-person visits and video calls at designated times and locations.\r\n1.2. Despite these explicit orders, Respondent has repeatedly and willfully violated the Court�s directive by denying Movant his rightful parenting time.\r\n1.3. Most recently, Respondent again denied Movant his court-ordered parenting time this weekend, despite clear instructions from this Court.\r\n2. Ongoing Emotional and Psychological Abuse of the Minor Child\r\n2.1. During a recent video call, the minor child, Felix, exhibited extreme emotional distress, crying uncontrollably for the entire duration of the call.\r\n2.2. Respondent has systematically taught the minor child to hang up on Movant over the past months, thereby actively facilitating alienation and destruction of the parent-child bond.\r\n2.3. When the child was no longer able to disconnect the call, he became severely distressed, at which point Respondent physically struck the child multiple times in an attempt to force compliance.\r\n2.4. Rather than comforting the child, Respondent escalated the situation, verbally reinforcing his distress and punishing him for expressing emotions.\r\n2.5. This behavior demonstrates a deliberate effort to emotionally manipulate and alienate the minor child, causing severe psychological harm.\r\n3. Contempt of Court and Request for Immediate Enforcement\r\n3.1. Respondent�s repeated and blatant disregard for this Court�s orders constitutes willful contempt and justifies immediate court intervention.\r\n3.2. The alienation, physical discipline, and emotional manipulation of the minor child must cease immediately, as these actions are abusive and cause irreparable harm to his well-being.\r\n4. Emergency Relief Requested\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Court to:\r\nFind Respondent in contempt of court for her repeated violations of court orders regarding parenting time and video calls;\r\nGrant an immediate hearing to address these violations and impose appropriate sanctions on Respondent;\r\nOrder make-up parenting time for all missed sessions and ensure strict enforcement moving forward;\r\nSuspend all video calls until such time that Respondent demonstrates a good faith effort to facilitate them without interference or emotional manipulation of the minor child;\r\nModify the current order to provide for immediate enforcement mechanisms to prevent further interference with parenting time, including law enforcement involvement if necessary;\r\nIssue any other relief this Court deems just and necessary in the best interest of the minor child.\r\nWherefore, Respondent requests the Court immediately reinstate my custody and grant any further relief deemed just and proper.`

    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, proceeding pro se, and respectfully petitions this Court to issue a Writ of Prohibition preventing the Honorable Matt Alan Selby from exercising further jurisdiction over the underlying custody matter due to judicial bias, obstruction of justice, and persistent violations of due process. In support, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n1. Jurisdiction and Legal Basis\r\n1.1. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Prohibition under Article V, Section 4 of the Missouri Constitution and Missouri Rule 84.22 et seq., which allows for prohibition to prevent a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or engaging in conduct that denies fundamental fairness.\r\n1.2. A Writ of Prohibition is appropriate where a judge has exhibited bias, refused to rule on critical motions, obstructed justice, or failed to uphold legal procedures in a manner that irreparably harms the litigant�s rights.\r\n1.3. Missouri case law supports the issuance of a Writ of Prohibition where a lower court acts in excess of its jurisdiction or engages in judicial misconduct (State ex rel. Riverside Joint Venture v. Missouri Gaming Comm�n, 969 S.W.2d 218, 222 (Mo. banc 1998)).\r\n1.4. A court�s refusal to rule on motions and evidence constitutes a violation of due process and may be corrected via extraordinary writ (State ex rel. Teefey v. Bd. of`

    date: "2025-3-4",
    type: "Notice",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `I am addressing the ongoing failure of this Court to enforce its own order regarding my psychological evaluation and the selective application of requirements that continue to benefit the Respondent.\r\nI, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, was ordered to complete a psychological evaluation. When I was directed toward a racially biased white psychologist, I motioned for an alternative and provided two Black psychologists. The Court granted my motion, yet Respondent has failed to schedule the required evaluation. Despite this, I complied to the best of my ability by undergoing evaluations through two AI psychologists. The Court has failed to enforce its own ruling while allowing Respondent to evade compliance entirely.\r\nAdditionally, I requested a psychological evaluation for Respondent to ensure fairness, yet the Court has ignored this motion, continuing the pattern of bias. If the Court will not enforce this order against Respondent, she should be barred from making psychological claims or defenses at trial.\r\nInstead of ruling on my motion to enforce compliance, the Court has chosen to delay all decisions by scheduling a last-minute hearing on April 4, 2025, lumping together all pending motions. However, this hearing has now been abruptly canceled without reason, further delaying justice and denying me my right to have these urgent matters addressed. The Court�s refusal to issue rulings while obstructing my ability to be heard is a clear procedural failure that only benefits Respondent at my expense.\r\nRather than addressing these issues, the Court appears focused on venue changes rather than issuing rulings. I request an immediate ruling enforcing Respondent�s compliance with the psychological evaluation order and sanctions for her failure to act. If the Court fails to enforce its order, Respondent must be barred from introducing psychological arguments in trial. The Court�s continued delay, along with the unjustified cancellation of scheduled proceedings, only compounds the procedural failures that have already prejudiced my case.\r\nJUDICIAL NOTICE OF COURT FAILURE TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION ORDER\r\nCOMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this Judicial Notice regarding the Court�s failure to enforce its own orders pertaining to psychological evaluations, stating as follows:\r\nPursuant to prior court orders, both parties were required to complete psychological evaluations.\r\nMovant has fully complied, completing and submitting two AI-based psychological evaluations in February 2025.\r\nRespondent was directed to schedule a psychological evaluation and was provided two Black psychologists for scheduling on March 18 2025 prior to this filing.\r\n\r\nVerified Qualified Evaluators � Respondent now submits two verified professionals with the credentials and experience necessary for psychological evaluations relevant to this case:\r\n\r\n\r\nCaleb M. Stephens, LMSW, LCSW � A licensed therapist based in Kansas City with extensive experience in trauma, family therapy, and psychological evaluations. Website: https://drcalebstephens.com.\r\nLiz Davis, LPC � A licensed professional counselor in Kansas City with expertise in psychological assessments and therapy. Website: https://www.lizdavistherapy.com.\r\n\r\nRespondent has failed to take any steps to complete the court-ordered evaluation, refusing to schedule with the provided professionals.\r\nMovant filed a Motion to Enforce Compliance with the psychological evaluation order, which has been ignored by the Court, despite Respondent�s continued noncompliance.\r\nThe Court�s failure to enforce its order enables Respondent�s continued refusal to comply, creating an unfair and prejudicial imbalance in these proceedings.\r\nThe Court�s selective enforcement of its own directives demonstrates judicial bias and improper favor toward Respondent.\r\nMovant requests an immediate ruling requiring Respondent�s compliance before trial or, in the alternative, barring Respondent from introducing any psychological arguments due to her failure to comply with the Court�s order.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nA. Issue an immediate ruling compelling Respondent�s compliance with the psychological evaluation order, with sanctions for continued refusal; or\r\nB. Prohibit Respondent from presenting any psychological-based claims or defenses in trial due to her failure to comply; andC. Grant any further relief this Court deems just and proper.`

    type: "Objection",
    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `COMES NOW the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully submits this formal objection to the cancellation of the scheduled hearing in the above-captioned case, and in support thereof states as follows:\r\nBackground: A hearing was duly scheduled for 04/04/2025, at which the Movant intended to present evidence, arguments, and motions relevant to the ongoing custody proceedings and related matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nCancellation of Hearing: On 04/03/2025, the Movant was notified that the scheduled hearing was cancelled. No prior notice or explanation regarding the cancellation was provided to the Movant, and this cancellation significantly disrupts the progress of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for Objection: The Movant respectfully objects to the cancellation of the hearing, as it violates the Movant�s right to a timely hearing under applicable law. Additionally, the cancellation of the hearing without adequate justification undermines the Movant�s ability to pursue relief and obtain a fair resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact of Cancellation: The cancellation of this hearing causes substantial prejudice to the Movant by delaying critical proceedings, including seeing Felix. The Movant has prepared for this hearing, including arranging necessary evidence, witnesses, and legal arguments, and as such, the cancellation imposes undue hardship and further delays the timely resolution of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest for Rescheduled Hearing: The Movant respectfully requests that this Court promptly reschedule the hearing at the earliest available date and allow the case to proceed without further undue delay. The Movant further requests that the Court consider the legal rights and interests at stake in this case, as well as the previous preparation and efforts made by the Movant to comply with the Court�s schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\na. Overrule the cancellation of the hearing;\r\n b. Reschedule the hearing for the earliest possible date; and\r\n c. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

    status: "Pending",
    content: `It is now undeniable that this court has permitted, if not actively facilitated, perjury, fraud, and racially motivated bias against me. I am formally demanding that you immediately forward the following legal matters to the District Attorney for prosecution, as is your duty under Kansas law:\r\nPerjury by Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove, who knowingly provided false testimony regarding my residence, fabricating instability to justify depriving me of my parental rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nFraudulent Legal Conduct by Josh Garrett, who orchestrated the perjury, manipulated evidence, and intentionally suppressed exculpatory facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllegal Temporary Custody Motion by Crycella Freitag, which was submitted without legal standing and in direct violation of jurisdictional law.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial Misconduct, including the deliberate falsification of docket entries, acceptance of known perjury, and the court�s complicity in racial discrimination against me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTampering with Evidence, as an altered video was knowingly entered into the record to misrepresent my character and manipulate the court�s perception.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a matter of discretion�it is a legal obligation. You are required to ensure that these violations are addressed and referred to the District Attorney:\r\nMark A. Dupree, Sr.\r\n District Attorney, Wyandotte County\r\n (913) 573-2851\r\nEMERGENCY MOTION TO STRIKE FABRICATED EVIDENCE, REMOVE PREJUDICIAL DOCKET ENTRIES, ACKNOWLEDGE PERJURY, AND ADDRESS UNLAWFUL TEMPORARY CUSTODY ORDER\r\nCOMES NOW, Movant, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and moves this Court for immediate relief regarding egregious procedural misconduct, willful judicial bias, and multiple violations of due process. In support of this Motion, Movant states as follows:\r\nI. STRIKING OF EDITED VIDEO SUBMISSION\r\nThe court has allowed the admission of an edited and misleading video into the record, clearly intended to distort the facts and prejudice the proceedings against Movant.\r\nThis video does not meet the evidentiary standards for authentication, completeness, or fairness as required under Missouri Rules of Evidence.\r\nMovant demands that this tainted evidence be stricken from the record immediately, and that any decisions or considerations made based on its content be vacated as a violation of due process.\r\nII. REMOVAL AND NOTATION OF PREJUDICIAL DOCKET ENTRIES\r\nThe docket entries contain statements that falsely frame Movant in a negative light, demonstrating clear and intentional bias by the Court.\r\nThese docket entries do not reflect actual proceedings or facts but instead serve as a tool to manufacture an unjustified narrative against Movant.\r\nMovant demands that all prejudicial docket entries be struck and that an official notation be entered correcting these misrepresentations.\r\nIII. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PERJURY IN COURT FILINGS\r\nRespondent and her witnesses, including but not limited to Jozef Hanratty and Josh Garrett, have engaged in perjury, presenting knowingly false statements to the Court.\r\nSpecific instances of perjury include, but are not limited to:\r\nFalse testimony regarding Movant�s living situation.\r\nFraudulent claims about financial hardship to deny Movant access to his child.\r\nCollusion with third parties to present fabricated narratives contradicting verified facts.\r\nMovant demands that the Court immediately address these acts of perjury and refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for criminal investigation.\r\nIV. UNLAWFUL TEMPORARY CUSTODY ORDER MUST BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY\r\nThe Court has allowed the enforcement of a temporary custody order that is in clear violation of Missouri law, as it was issued based on procedurally defective motions that lacked legal standing and factual merit.\r\nThis order was obtained through fraudulent representations and should be voided immediately, with full custody reconsidered in favor of Movant based on the egregious conduct of the Respondent.\r\nFurthermore, Movant demands that the Court justify why it has repeatedly ignored clear violations of law and due process, which has directly harmed both Movant and the minor child.\r\nV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Honorable Court:\r\nStrike the altered video from the record and prohibit its use in any further proceedings.\r\nRemove and formally correct prejudicial docket entries that misrepresent the facts.\r\nAcknowledge perjury committed by Respondent and her witnesses and refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.\r\nImmediately vacate the unlawful temporary custody order and reconsider custody arrangements based on verified evidence.\r\nGrant any other relief this Court deems necessary and just to rectify these severe violations of due process and judicial integrity.`

    date: "2025-4-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `MOTION TO ADDRESS MANIPULATION AND NONCOMPLIANCE REGARDING COURT-ORDERED PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION\r\nCOMES NOW, Movant, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and moves this Court to acknowledge the Respondent�s and their counsel�s deliberate failure to comply with Court-ordered psychological evaluations, as well as the ongoing judicial bias and manipulation of this requirement to paint Movant in a false and negative light. In support thereof, Movant states as follows:\r\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn 12/13/2024, the Court granted a temporary custody order to Respondent based on the false premise that Movant had unstable living conditions. This was based on perjured testimony from Jozef Hanratty.\r\nThe Court explicitly stated that if Movant remained in his home beyond a week, it would prove Hanratty�s testimony was false.\r\nTwo weeks later, Movant was still in his home. The Court, instead of acknowledging this, asked Josh Garrett to confirm the claim, who falsely stated, \"Kelly Truelove wants him out!\"\r\nTwo months later, Kelly Truelove filed a fraudulent eviction lawsuit, which was immediately dismissed, confirming collusion between Respondent, her counsel, and their witnesses.\r\nOn 01/29/2025, Judge Selby continued to dismiss Movant�s evidence submissions while enabling perjury and parental alienation.\r\nInstead of correcting this injustice, Judge Selby further prejudiced Movant by ordering a psychological evaluation while ignoring Movant�s December 16, 2024 request for Respondent to undergo the same evaluation.\r\nMovant initially objected to the examiners provided by the Court due to their lack of experience with diverse families. On 02/26/2025, Movant filed a Motion to Object to Psychological Examiners.\r\nOn 03/11/2025, Judge Selby granted Movant�s motion to use alternative evaluators, and Movant promptly provided Respondent and her counsel with a list of two qualified Black psychologists.\r\nDespite agreeing to set up the evaluation, opposing counsel engaged in a pattern of obstruction, refusing to schedule the evaluation while engaging in tactics designed to entrap Movant into admitting noncompliance.\r\nMovant engaged in 36 documented email exchanges with opposing counsel, where Movant repeatedly clarified that they needed to schedule the court-ordered evaluation. Respondent and her counsel refused to do so while making sarcastic remarks and further manipulating the process.\r\nThe only evaluators suggested by opposing counsel were white psychologists, despite Movant clearly indicating their preference for an examiner with experience in diverse family dynamics.\r\nThe Court�s ongoing refusal to acknowledge this pattern of obstruction while allowing Respondent to feign compliance demonstrates judicial bias.\r\nII. ARGUMENT\r\nRespondent�s Failure to Comply: The Court ordered both parties to undergo psychological evaluations. Movant provided evaluators, yet Respondent has taken no action to comply.\r\nOpposing Counsel�s Bad Faith Tactics: Instead of complying, opposing counsel engaged in deceptive tactics to manipulate the narrative and paint Movant as noncompliant.\r\nJudicial Bias & Procedural Misconduct: The Court has ignored Movant�s motions and evidence submissions while continuously enabling Respondent�s noncompliance.\r\nDue Process Violation: The Court has denied Movant due process by selectively enforcing orders to Movant�s detriment.\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Court to:\r\nA. Issue an immediate ruling compelling Respondent to comply with the psychological evaluation order and schedule an appointment with one of the approved evaluators within seven (7) days. B. Sanction Respondent and her counsel for bad faith conduct and their deliberate attempts to obstruct compliance. C. Bar Respondent from introducing any psychological-based arguments or defenses at trial due to her failure to comply with the Court order. D. Acknowledge and correct the judicial bias demonstrated in the handling of this issue, ensuring future impartial enforcement of all court orders. E. Grant any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.`

    content: `COMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for the inclusion of narrative docket entries and the preservation of a complete appellate record in the above-captioned matter. In support of this motion, Movant states as follows:\r\nThat Movant has made repeated good faith efforts to verify the status of filings, hearings, and judicial rulings in this matter, including contacting the Clerk’s Office and relevant personnel.\r\nThat on April 7, 2025, at approximately 8:08 am, Movant contacted the Clerk's Office to confirm the scheduled court hearing for April 9, 2025, at 9:00 AM and to verify the Court's awareness and review of recent emergency motions, including those filed during the week of March 25–April 1, 2025.\r\nThat despite proper filing, multiple emergency motions remain unacknowledged on the docket, and no rulings have been issued—particularly in relation to facts that contradict verified records in the Movant’s Kansas case.\r\nThat this delay, pattern of silence, and failure to address material filings constitutes not only obstruction of justice, but has hindered Movant’s ability to collect and preserve exculpatory evidence critical to the full and fair adjudication of this matter.\r\nThat the pattern of procedural irregularities, administrative resistance to access, and judicial inaction demonstrates an ongoing failure of this Court to protect Movant’s rights, and creates an unjust prejudice that will likely continue unless the record is preserved with full narrative documentation.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nOrder the clerk to include a narrative record of all filings, inquiries, and communications made by the Movant related to this matter since March 25, 2025, including verification attempts regarding the judge’s review of emergency motions;\r\nConfirm and record all pending motions yet to be ruled on as part of the official docket for appellate review;\r\nPreserve all correspondence, hearing logs, and court call logs from April 1–April 9, 2025, to ensure an unbroken chain of procedural transparency for appellate scrutiny.`

    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to strike any outstanding order or implication requiring participation in a psychological evaluation conducted by Midtown Psychological Services, and in support thereof, states the following:\r\n\r\n1. Procedural Background\r\nOn or about February 26, 2025, Movant was contacted by Midtown Psychological Services, stating they had been contacted by Sarah, an associate of the Garrett Law Firm, and had been assigned to conduct a psychological evaluation of Movant allegedly pursuant to a court order.\r\nThe provider confirmed the initial communication came solely from Respondent’s legal counsel, with no record of direct court appointment or oversight. Further, Respondent Crycella Freitag personally paid for the evaluation, a clear breach of neutrality and procedural integrity.\r\nMovant immediately requested written clarification regarding the referral process, scope of evaluation, and the provider’s neutrality. No clarification or court confirmation was received.\r\n\r\n2. Midtown Psychological Has Withdrawn\r\nOn April 9, 2025, Movant contacted Midtown Psychological Services. During this call, a representative from their office stated that Midtown Psychological has formally declined to be involved in this case and has requested that the Garrett Law Firm not contact their office again.\r\nThe provider’s withdrawal confirms that the original evaluation order was not arranged through a neutral process, but instead unilaterally initiated and funded by Respondent and her legal team.\r\n\r\n3. Request for Court Relief\r\nMovant is not opposed to participating in a psychological evaluation so long as it is:\r\nCourt-appointed through a neutral selection process, and\r\nConducted by an evaluator with no prior affiliation with either party.\r\nIn light of these developments, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nStrike any evaluation order referencing Midtown Psychological or resulting from unilateral appointment by Respondent’s counsel.\r\nIssue a new order appointing a neutral, court-selected evaluator, with costs split equitably or determined by the Court.\r\n\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the relief requested above, strike the existing referral to Midtown Psychological Services, and appoint a neutral psychological evaluator in accordance with fair and impartial procedures.`

    date: "2025-9-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to vacate its order requiring evaluation by Midtown Psychological Services (\"Midtown\") for the following reasons:\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\nThe Court’s order conditioned any custody modification on Movant completing an evaluation with Midtown—a provider now unavailable due to their refusal to work with Respondent’s counsel (Garrett Law Firm) for ethical reasons.\r\nMidtown’s rejection of Garrett Law Firm confirms:\r\nThe evaluation process was tainted by Respondent’s counsel’s misconduct.\r\nThe Court’s order is now impossible to comply with, as Midtown will not proceed.\r\nThe Court’s linkage of custody to this evaluation punishes Movant for Respondent’s counsel’s actions and violates due process.\r\n\r\nII. LEGAL GROUNDS\r\nA. The Evaluation Order is Void Due to Impossibility\r\nMO Rule 68.01: Court-ordered evaluations must be neutral. Midtown’s withdrawal proves the process was compromised.\r\nMO Supreme Court Precedent: Orders requiring impossible acts (e.g., evaluations with conflicted providers) are unenforceable (State ex rel. M.D.K., 445 S.W.3d 543 (Mo. App. 2014)).\r\n\r\nB. The Garrett Law Firm’s Misconduct Invalided the Process\r\nMidtown’s refusal to work with Garrett Law Firm after payment from Respondent confirms:\r\nEx parte coordination between Respondent’s counsel and the evaluator.\r\nFinancial bias (Respondent pre-paid Midtown before the order issued).\r\n\r\nC. The Court’s Custody Condition is Retaliatory\r\nThe Court’s sole reason for denying modification was Movant’s non-compliance with Midtown’s evaluation—an evaluation now proven unethical.\r\nConditioning custody on a tainted evaluation violates fundamental fairness (In re Marriage of Denton, 169 S.W.3d 604 (Mo. App. 2005)).\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nMovant respectfully requests:\r\nAn order vacating the requirement to undergo evaluation with Midtown Psychological Services.\r\nA finding that Respondent’s counsel’s actions rendered the evaluation process void ab initio.\r\nPermission to seek an independent evaluator from a court-approved panel, with costs borne by Respondent due to her counsel’s misconduct.\r\nAn immediate hearing on custody modification, as the Court’s prior condition is now moot.\r\nIV. CONCLUSION\r\nThe Court cannot enforce an order premised on an unethical, impossible act. Movant seeks justice untainted by Garrett Law Firm’s bad-faith tactics.`

    date: "2025-10-4",
    type: "Notice",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this formal notice and demand for judicial correction in response to the Court's prior directive regarding the psychological evaluation at Midtown Psychological Associates, and the Court’s continued failure to issue rulings on properly filed and documented motions.\r\nOn the record during the hearing held on or about 4/9/2025 9:00am, the Honorable Judge Matt Alan Selby directly threatened the undersigned with contempt if he did not obtain a psychological evaluation specifically from Midtown Psychological Associates.\r\n\r\nOn the record during the hearing, Judge Selby threatened to end the hearing every time Movant tried to correct the record, or defend himself making it an impossible environment of recognized biased rulings.   \r\n\r\nMovant has made every good faith effort to comply with this directive. However, Midtown Psychological Associates has explicitly refused to provide services due to their policy of not working with Garrett Law Firm, who represents Respondent. This makes compliance with the Court's directive factually and legally impossible.\r\n\r\nDespite multiple filings and full documentation disproving every harmful allegation made against the Movant, the Court has failed to rule on any of Movant’s motions, and have not provided any future hearings without explanation or notice of rescheduling.\r\n\r\nThe Court’s refusal to acknowledge or correct its misdirected contempt threats and procedural errors has created a situation of ongoing prejudice, harm, and constitutional deprivation to Movant, who remains unable to exercise custodial rights due to this unresolved matter.\r\n\r\nEach day this error is left uncorrected, it further compounds the damage to Movant’s legal position, personal stability, and most critically his relationship with the minor child.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no legal or factual justification for the continued separation of the minor child, Felix, from Movant. All previous allegations have been disproven or rendered moot, and yet no hearing is scheduled. This flagrant delay in justice and access to due process constitutes a continuing violation of Movant’s civil rights under color of state law, and may give rise to federal review or civil rights litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\r\nKelly Truelove played a critical role in validating false claims about Micheal’s housing stability during custody proceedings, despite lacking a direct rental agreement with him. Her decision to proceed with eviction efforts, combined with her refusal to clarify her communication boundaries and reliance on Jozef Hanratty’s authority, suggests possible coordination with Crycella Freitag and Josh Garrett. Given Josh Garrett's on-record statements attributing key information to Kelly, and her indirect influence on custody-related narratives, it is essential to subpoena all text message records between Kelly Truelove, Crycella Freitag, and Josh Garrett to determine the extent of collusion, perjury, or strategic misrepresentation intended to harm Micheal’s parental rights.\r\nAdditionally, the Court has failed to forward documented allegations against Jozef Hanratty to the appropriate prosecutorial authorities, despite multiple filings identifying three clear instances of perjury, committed knowingly and willfully during custody proceedings. The police previously issued a verbal warning to Mr. Hanratty regarding his involvement, yet he continued to inject himself into the litigation, materially influencing the case with demonstrable falsehoods. The Court's refusal to act or refer the matter to the District Attorney further obstructs the proper administration of justice and emboldens continued abuse of the legal process.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant demands immediate judicial correction of the record regarding the threatened contempt, psychological evaluation and the immediate scheduling of a hearing on the outstanding motions and issues.`

    date: "2025-10-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to take immediate judicial corrective action and schedule an emergency hearing in light of ongoing violations of due process, false representations made by opposing counsel regarding third-party service providers, and the resulting deprivation of Movant’s custodial access. In support thereof, Movant states the following:\r\n\r\nI. IMMEDIATE ISSUE: USE OF NON-EXISTENT ENTITY TO OBSTRUCT REUNIFICATION\r\nThe entity referred to as \"KidCentric\" has been referenced in prior discussions related to court-ordered services or evaluations in this case.\r\nUpon investigation, there is no active or registered business operating under the name \"KidCentric\" in the State of Kansas. The only such entity was forfeited and administratively dissolved.\r\nMovant was placed in a position of relying on this non-existent provider for crucial services affecting his custodial rights, including but not limited to visitation facilitation and psychological evaluation pathways.\r\nThis constitutes material misrepresentation by opposing counsel and/or a grave procedural error by the Court, as no party should be ordered or expected to comply with an order that references a defunct or non-operational entity.\r\n\r\nII. EVALUATION PROVIDER IS REFUSING CONTACT DUE TO JOSH GARRETT\r\nThe Court additionally ordered Movant to obtain a psychological evaluation through Midtown Psychological Associates, and threatened contempt if he failed to comply.\r\nMovant made every good faith effort to schedule said evaluation; however, Midtown Psychological Associates has explicitly refused to provide services due to their refusal to work with Garrett Law Firm, who represents Respondent.\r\nThis renders the evaluation directive legally and practically impossible to comply with, through no fault of the Movant.\r\nYet, Movant remains under the implied threat of contempt and suffers continued separation from his son, Felix, without legal basis.\r\n\r\nIII. COURT’S FAILURE TO SCHEDULE A HEARING OR RULE ON MOTIONS\r\nThe Court has failed to respond to or act upon multiple properly filed and time-sensitive emergency motions submitted by the Movant, including those requesting corrections, protective orders, and judicial review of procedural errors.\r\nThe Court has also removed all scheduled hearings without rescheduling or notice, leaving the Movant in a state of procedural limbo with no avenue to be heard and removed all phone contact allowing Movant no way to contact Felix.\r\nThis denial of access to the Court, coupled with the refusal to correct directives that are impossible to comply with, has resulted in a flagrant deprivation of Movant’s due process and parental rights under both the Missouri Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\r\n\r\nIV. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MISCONDUCT BY OPPOSING COUNSEL\r\nOpposing counsel, Josh Garrett, has made repeated misrepresentations to the Court and has leveraged false narratives—including the Layne Project cancellation and \"KidCentric\" mislabeling—to paint the Movant as unstable or non-compliant.\r\nMr. Garrett knowingly omitted exculpatory evidence showing that Crycella Freitag refused to pay for court-ordered visitation at Layne Project, and later used that cancellation to push for an unjustified psychological evaluation through a provider who now refuses contact with his firm.\r\n\r\nThis conduct constitutes bad faith litigation, obstruction, and possibly fraud upon the court, warranting sanctions and referral to the appropriate disciplinary body.\r\n\r\nV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests the following:\r\nThat the Court schedule an emergency hearing within seven (7) days to address the false representation of \"KidCentric\" and the impossibility of complying with the psychological evaluation order;\r\nThat the Court formally strike or correct any orders involving non-existent or defunct entities, and issue a revised evaluation directive through a neutral and available provider;\r\nThat the Court order immediate restoration of unsupervised parenting time until such time as lawful procedures are properly followed;\r\nThat the Court issue sanctions against Josh Garrett for misrepresentation, bad faith, and suppression of exculpatory evidence; and\r\nThat the Court provide immediate clarity regarding all outstanding motions and scheduling, so as to prevent further deprivation of Movant’s rights under color of law.`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this emergency motion for judicial correction and relief, and for the immediate scheduling of a hearing regarding the inclusion of “KidCentric” as a referenced entity in this case. Movant further seeks clarification, protection, and relief against continued procedural obstruction, as this provider has now been confirmed to be unregistered, unlicensed, and uncooperative—resulting in a complete denial of access to the minor child and violation of the Movant’s constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nI. BACKGROUND AND COMMUNICATION RECORD\r\nOn April 10, 2025, Movant made a final effort to contact \"KidCentric\" after six prior failed attempts. A response was received from a personal cell phone (785-424-3700), identifying the speaker only as “Julie,” who claimed to be the director of KidCentric.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Movant asked for formal business verification, license, or legal documentation of this provider’s standing, “Julie” refused to provide any such documentation, stating, quote, “You can find what you need online. I am not providing any physical documents to you.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon being pressed for documentation or confirmation of the entity’s legitimacy, she threatened to block Movant and further stated, quote, “I will advise the court I will not be providing services for you,” without stating why or how.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic records show no registered, active business under the name “KidCentric” in Kansas, and the only such business has been forfeited. No verifiable business license, EIN, or professional affiliation has been disclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interaction is consistent with fraudulent activity, or at a minimum, an unregulated service attempting to influence judicial proceedings without accountability, documentation, or transparency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DUE PROCESS VIOLATION AND COMPLETE DENIAL OF ACCESS\r\nThe Court’s reliance on \"KidCentric\" or any affiliated actor has now resulted in a total shutdown of reunification and communication between Movant and the minor child.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, in conjunction with Midtown Psychological Associates’ refusal to coordinate with Garrett Law Firm, has rendered all court-ordered options for compliance and parenting time functionally and legally impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no court date set to resolve these critical issues, despite multiple emergency motions filed, and Movant is being denied access to his child based entirely on fabricated and unlawful third-party involvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests the following:\r\nThat the Court issue an immediate order striking any reference to “KidCentric” or its alleged representatives from the record and from any future orders or considerations;\r\n\r\nThat the Court order an investigation into the nature of the service, including any statements made by “KidCentric” to the Court and whether they were initiated by or in coordination with opposing counsel;\r\n\r\nThat the Court schedule an emergency hearing within seven (7) days to review this obstruction, reset service provider arrangements through a neutral and verified party, and address the ongoing constitutional violations facing the Movant;\r\n\r\nThat opposing counsel be held accountable for presenting, supporting, or coordinating with non-licensed entities, and that sanctions be considered if the obstruction is found to be strategic or knowing;\r\n\r\nThat Movant’s access to his child be restored immediately or a pathway be established through legitimate and legally accountable channels, not fabricated or unverifiable third parties.`

    content: `COMES NOW Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for emergency relief based on the following facts and supporting legal standards:\r\n\r\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn April 12, 2025, Brook Gipson (MO Bar #72816) was appointed as Guardian ad Litem for the minor child, Felix Day Salmon.\r\nAs of April 16, 2025�five full days since appointment�Movant has received no contact or acknowledgment from Ms. Gipson.\r\nMovant has made numerous attempts to initiate contact, including:\r\n\r\n\r\nCalls to Ms. Gipson�s law office\r\nDirect communication with her secretary\r\nMultiple email correspondences\r\n\r\n\r\nThese attempts are fully documented and time-stamped in Movant�s public Legal Audit App available at:\r\n https://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html\r\nMs. Gipson�s complete failure to initiate communication is a direct violation of her obligations under Missouri Revised Statute � 452.423, which states:\r\n �The guardian ad litem shall be the legal representative of the child and may, when appropriate, present evidence and recommendations to the court concerning the best interests of the child.�\r\n This presumes actual engagement with the parties and investigation�neither of which have occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. JUDICIAL REMARKS INDICATING BIAS AND PROCEDURAL ABUSE\r\nAt the last hearing, the Court stated on record its refusal to alter the temporary custody order \"no matter what.\"\r\nThe Court also expressed intent to dismiss the case and allow the GAL�s final recommendations to stand uncontested.\r\nThese statements, paired with the GAL�s dereliction of duty, result in a complete denial of Movant�s right to due process and fair adjudication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND IRREPARABLE HARM\r\nMovant asserts that the ongoing deprivation of parent-child contact, with direct assistance or willful neglect by the Court and GAL, constitutes a state-sponsored deprivation of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution, actionable under 42 U.S. Code �?1983.\r\nRespondent's behavior�denying all contact with Felix for nearly three months�amounts to parental alienation, compounded by: The Court�s refusal to enforce access or review new evidence, The GAL�s failure to initiate contact, investigate, or act in the child�s best interest, Public officers exercising authority under color of state law to enable this deprivation\r\nThese combined actions violate the substantive and procedural due process rights of both Movant and the minor child under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nMoreover, Movant contends that these officials have acted with deliberate indifference, and seeks the record to reflect a notice of intent to pursue federal civil rights action under: 42 U.S. Code � 1983 � Civil action for deprivation of rights, 42 U.S. Code � 1985 � Conspiracy to interfere with civil rights, Kansas and Missouri Human Rights Acts, as applicable, U.S. Supreme Court precedent: Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982) � heightened protections in parental rights termination, Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) � fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of children\r\nStanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972) � unwed fathers have equal constitutional protection to custody\r\nIV. NOTICE OF FEDERAL ACTION AND PRESERVATION OF RECORDS\r\nMovant places this Court and all parties on formal notice of his intent to pursue federal civil rights litigation related to: Judicial misconduct, GAL dereliction of duty, Ongoing parental rights violations \r\nV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nMovant respectfully requests the following:\r\nA. That this Court compel Guardian ad Litem Brook Gipson to initiate contact with Movant within three (3) business days, and file a formal progress report within three (3) business days, or be disqualified and replaced for cause;\r\nB. That this Court schedule an emergency hearing to address:\r\nThe GAL�s failure to perform her duties\r\nCrycella�s willful interference with custody and communication\r\nThis Court�s prior statements regarding refusal to consider factual changes\r\nC. That this Court grant immediate, court-ordered contact between Micheal and Felix, via custody order modification;\r\nD. That the Court preserve the record for appellate review, as these actions (or inactions) may constitute judicial misconduct and/or procedural deprivation.`

    title: "MOTION TO ACKNOWLEDGE FRAUDULENT GUARDIAN AD LITEM APPOINTMENT, COURT DELAY TACTICS, AND INTENTIONAL OBSTRUCTION OF ACCESS TO CHILD",
    date: "2025-17-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `Comes now, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Movant and natural father of Felix Day Salmon, and respectfully submits this Motion to preserve a clear record of procedural violations, fraudulent representations, and denial of due process now ongoing in this matter.\r\n\r\nI. FRAUDULENT GUARDIAN AD LITEM APPOINTMENT\r\nOn or about April 12, 2025, the Court purported to appoint Brook Gipson as Guardian ad Litem (GAL) in this matter.\r\nDespite diligent efforts to confirm her identity, Movant has been unable to locate any record of Brook Gipson on Missouri Case.net, on file with the Missouri Bar, or via direct contact with either Ozarks Law Firm or Rooney McBride & Smith, who have repeatedly made conflicting and evasive claims regarding her identity.\r\nGiven the total lack of professional footprint, the Movant reasonably believes that no such individual actively serves as GAL, and that this appointment may have been fictitious.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovant reserves the right to issue a subpoena in future discovery or appeal to compel testimony from the above firms, and from the Court itself if necessary, regarding the existence and participation of �Brook Gipson.�\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. COURT DELAY STRATEGY TO EVADE REVIEW\r\nMovant places on the record that Judge Matt Alan Selby, in open court, stated:\r\n �It�s getting close to the six-month rule, and I�m planning on dismissing.�\r\nThis comment, paired with the ongoing refusal to schedule or rule on Movant�s valid motions, indicates a deliberate strategy to delay adjudication long enough to dismiss this case on a technicality�despite jurisdictional objections and ongoing violations of Movant�s parental rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE MOTION DAYS OR RULE ON MOTIONS\r\nPer Stone County Local Rule 2.4.1, today�April 17, 2025�is a designated Motion Day for Associate Division II.\r\nMovant�s Emergency Motion, filed in advance and compliant with docket requirements, was intentionally omitted from the docket.\r\nThe Clerk�s Office falsely told Movant the next hearing date was May 2, 2025, which is not a Motion Day for this division.\r\nThis is a direct violation of Rule 2.4.1, designed to obstruct access to relief and further enable dismissal without hearing the evidence.\r\n\r\nIV. NO ACCESS TO CHILD, NO LEGAL REMEDY\r\nMovant has been completely denied access to his son, Felix Day Salmon, despite multiple filings and attempts to resolve issues peacefully.\r\nThe court-sanctioned facility for visitation�KidCentric�has been proven a fraudulent or inactive entity.\r\nDespite clear evidence, the Court refuses to take judicial notice of this or hold any hearings to address Movant�s inability to even see his child under the current order.\r\nThese failures constitute a deprivation of fundamental rights, exacerbated by the Court�s inaction.\r\nV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF (FOR THE RECORD)\r\nMovant acknowledges this Motion will likely be ignored by the Court, as previous filings have been. Nevertheless, for purposes of appeal, legal audit, and potential federal review, Movant requests:\r\nA written response confirming whether �Brook Gipson� is a real person, licensed attorney, and active GAL;\r\nA ruling on Movant�s Emergency Motion filed prior to April 17 Motion Day;\r\nAn order compelling confirmation of a real visitation path, including whether KidCentric exists or is legally operational;\r\nAny explanation from the Court as to why motions are not being heard despite being filed and compliant with local rules.\r\nVI. NOTICE OF PARALLEL ACTION AND RESERVED RIGHTS\r\nMovant further notifies this Court that he is initiating parallel legal proceedings in the State of Kansas, the child�s true home state pursuant to UCCJEA standards. Movant expressly reserves all rights to use evidence, transcripts, and filings from this Missouri proceeding in related or future litigation�including to expose misconduct, perjury, or fraud by the opposing party or associated counsel. However, due to Missouri�s lack of jurisdiction and ongoing procedural violations, no rulings, findings, or dismissals from this Court shall be construed to prejudice or interfere with the Kansas proceedings, nor shall they limit Movant�s legal remedies or standing therein.`

    title: "MOTION TO STRIKE DECLINED APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIAN AD LITEM, AND PRESERVE RECORD FOR SANCTIONS AND CIVIL ACTION",
    date: "2025-21-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully requests this Court to strike the recently filed �Declination� of Guardian ad Litem Brooke D. Gipson, filed by Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC, in tandem with Ozarks Legal and for the immediate dismissal of Case No. 24SN-DR00104. This Motion is made on the basis of materially false statements, documented misconduct, and ethical violations presented in the filing submitted by Ms. Gipson�s firms. In support of this Motion, Movant states the following:\r\n\r\n1. Procedural Timeline Proves Fabrication\r\nBrooke D. Gipson was appointed Guardian ad Litem by this Court on April 12, 2025.\r\nThe Declination, submitted by Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC, states that Movant called the firm \"within the last two days before the guardian could even officially accept the appointment\"�i.e., April 10 or prior.\r\nTherefore, any interaction alleged occurred before Ms. Gipson�s appointment�when she had no role, duty, or standing in the case.\r\nThis alone invalidates the claim of conflict of interest and undermines the entire basis for declination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Recorded Communication Contradicts Their Claims\r\nThe firm claims Movant �called multiple times, yelled at staff, and threatened to sue the firm.� This is categorically false.\r\nEvery call was recorded. The tone remains professional throughout. No yelling occurred.\r\nThe �threat� referenced was a statement that if the firm refused to acknowledge or respond to lawful inquiry, Movant would be forced to subpoena their records and potentially seek legal remedy.\r\nThis is not a threat�it is due process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Ethical and Legal Issues with the Filing\r\nThe Declination was signed with a typed font signature (Lobster font) rather than a real, verifiable signature from Ms. Gipson. On the back, it was just italics in Arial.\r\nUnder Missouri Supreme Court Rule 55.03 and Rule 4-3.3, submitting filings containing falsehoods and improper signatures may constitute sanctionable conduct and grounds for discipline.\r\nThe firm�s filing constitutes an intentional misrepresentation to the court, and appears to serve no purpose other than to:\r\nAvoid court-appointed duties.\r\nSmear the Movant�s character.\r\nCreate unnecessary delay and confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Pattern of Obstruction\r\nThis conduct is consistent with a broader pattern of obstruction and bad faith exhibited by parties aligned with Movant throughout this matter.\r\nGAL services are meant to serve the best interests of the child�not the strategic convenience of a party or their affiliated professionals.\r\nMs. Gipson and her firm never contacted Movant, and no communication was initiated before filing this declination�further demonstrating the filing was retaliatory and defensive, not professional or neutral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Public Record and Civil Action Reserved\r\nThis exchange, including audio files and the original filed letter, www.SalmonAudit.info\r\nMovant explicitly reserves the right to pursue civil damages against Ozarks Law, Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC and Brooke D. Gipson for:\r\nDefamation.\r\nFiling materially false statements with the court.\r\nProcedural sabotage of a custody case involving a minor child.\r\nMovant also reserves the right to file a formal complaint with the Missouri Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel for ethical violations pursuant to Rules 4-3.1, 4-3.3, and 4-8.4(c).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nStrike the GAL Declination filed by Brooke D. Gipson;\r\nIssue an order acknowledging the timeline and fabricated nature of the claims within the Declination;\r\nPreserve the record for potential sanctions or further proceedings involving misconduct;\r\nGrant Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Full physical and Sole custody of Minor Felix Day Salmon.\r\nAttachments:\r\nExhibit A: Declination Letter from Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC`

    date: "2025-21-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the undersigned Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to take Judicial Notice of Procedural Default and to immediately issue an order for full custodial transfer of the minor child, Felix Day Salmon, to Petitioner, for the reasons stated below:\r\n\r\nI. PROCEDURAL DEFAULT & ABANDONMENT OF DUTY\r\nThe Guardian ad Litem originally appointed by this Court, Brooke D. Gibson of Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC, has filed a formal decline of appointment dated April 18, 2025, citing fabricated conduct unsupported by fact and in direct contradiction to recorded interactions now entered into evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo substitute Guardian ad Litem has been appointed since her declination, despite this Court being aware of the urgent necessity due to the pending final hearing, serious allegations of parental alienation, and legal misconduct affecting the welfare of the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis failure constitutes a procedural default under Missouri Supreme Court Rules 68.01 and Rule 129.02, as the child's right to representation has been effectively ignored by the Court for over 70 days since the initial order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. EVIDENT COLLUSION, PERJURY, AND JURISDICTIONAL SPILLOVER FROM KANSAS\r\nPetitioner provides notice that matters arising from this case are not confined to Missouri jurisdiction. A series of acts involving fraud, perjury, and collusion�including testimony and sworn statements by Carolyn Salmon, the Layne Project, Crycella Freitag, Stephanie Reed, Natasha Kluttz, Kelly Truelove and Jozef Hanratty�are directly tied to the deprivation of the Petitioner�s parental rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese acts occurred primarily in Wyandotte County, Kansas, where Felix resided for the majority of his life, and where multiple witnesses lied to both courts and law enforcement to create the false appearance of instability.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegardless of Missouri's continued silence, Petitioner reserves all rights to prosecute and subpoena individuals under Kansas law and intends to pursue civil and criminal accountability where Missouri fails to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EMERGENCY REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF CUSTODY\r\nIn light of:\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Court�s abandonment of its duty to appoint a GAL,\r\n\r\n\r\nthe lack of any communication from the Court despite multiple motions,\r\n\r\n\r\nthe now-confirmed procedural and ethical misconduct within this Court�s jurisdiction,\r\n\r\n\r\nand ongoing harm to Felix due to protracted delay and parental deprivation,\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner hereby demands immediate full legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon.\r\nPetitioner is willing to offer Respondent, Crycella T. D., four (4) hours of unsupervised parenting time per week pending further court review, but asserts this shall not delay enforcement of this emergency custody order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. CONCLUSION\r\nThis Court has entered a state of inaction that has materially harmed the child, denied Petitioner due process, and allowed misinformation and unlawful behavior to persist unchecked. Therefore, Petitioner respectfully demands:\r\nJudicial acknowledgment of procedural default under Missouri rules;\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediate granting of full custody to Petitioner;\r\n\r\n\r\nAffirmation of Petitioner�s right to pursue legal recourse in Kansas regarding perjury and fraud in connection to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA copy of all referenced communications, including recorded calls disproving the GAL�s stated basis for declining appointment, is appended and cataloged at:\r\n\r\nhttps://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html`

Petitioner only became aware of this entry by cross-referencing mailed materials with docket entries after the fact.\r\nFinancial and Logistical Hardship: Petitioner resides in Kansas City, Kansas, and travel to the Stone County Courthouse imposes a significant burden both financially and logistically. Petitioner is also solely responsible for the care of minor child Felix Day Salmon when not obstructed.\r\nDue Process and Oversight Considerations: Given ongoing procedural irregularities, including substantial issues surrounding the performance and qualifications of the recently appointed Guardian ad Litem, Attorney Mark Stephens, Petitioner intends to raise substantive concerns with the Court in a subsequent motion.

    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully notifies this Honorable Court of a repeated behavioral pattern by the Respondent, Crycella Freitag, which directly impacts the minor child, Felix Day Salmon, causing emotional distress and unnecessary restriction, as follows:\nIncident Description:\nOn or about 4\/24\/2025, during the only allowed parenting time with Felix, the minor child Felix was audibly heard and seen slamming his hands against a door and screaming from inside a bedroom, attempting to exit. Petitioner directly observed and documented this behavior as a clear sign of distress and desire to leave the restricted environment.\nPetitioner's Attempt to Intervene:\nPetitioner immediately requested that Respondent allow the child to exit the room, both to alleviate distress and to determine the reason for Felix's emotional state. Respondent refused to allow the child out, disregarding the child's physical signals and Petitioner's reasonable request.\nPattern of Behavior:\nThis is not an isolated occurrence. The refusal to allow Felix to exit a room, despite emotional signals and repeated cries, is part of a broader, ongoing pattern of restrictive and emotionally dismissive behavior by Respondent. Petitioner asserts that such behavior is emotionally harmful, suppresses the minor child's agency and safety, and contributes to a toxic environment.\nRequest for Judicial Notice and Inclusion in Record:\nPetitioner respectfully requests the Court to take judicial notice of this incident and include it in the behavioral history relevant to custody and visitation decisions. Further, Petitioner requests the Court to consider this pattern when determining the best interest of the child and to permit further documentation of these events in Petitioner's legal audit archive, available at SalmonAudit.info, which maintains a chronological, evidenced-based public record of all relevant incidents.\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays this Court acknowledge the incident as evidence of an escalating pattern of obstruction, consider this in future custody determinations, and grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

      date: "2024-2-12",
      type: "Motion",
      status: "Overruled",
      content: `TO THE HONORABLE COURT:
  I, Michael Salmon, appearing Pro Se, respectfully move this Court to transfer venue for this case from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience of all parties and witnesses, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).
  
  I. Introduction
  This motion seeks to transfer venue to the District of Kansas, where both parties currently reside, to reduce undue burdens on the parties and ensure efficient resolution of this matter. The current venue in Missouri imposes significant logistical and financial challenges, making it impractical for the parties and witnesses.
  
  II. Factual Background
  1. Parties’ Residences:
     - I, Michael Salmon, reside at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas, 66103.
     - The Plaintiff, Crycella Freitag, resides in Pomona, Kansas.
  2. Current Venue Impact:
     - The current venue in Missouri is over four hours away from both parties’ homes, making travel difficult.
  3. Efforts to Cooperate:
     - I relocated from Missouri to Kansas to facilitate co-parenting and reduce travel burdens, moving within 40 minutes of the Plaintiff.
  4. Personal and Community Ties in Kansas:
     - Our two-year-old son, Felix, attends a Montessori school and is actively involved in community activities in Kansas, including church and friendships.
     - Both families reside in Kansas, making it a more practical location for witness testimonies.
  5. Financial and Work Constraints:
     - As a full-time single father, taking time off work to travel four hours each way for court proceedings is unfeasible.
     - The Plaintiff also works full-time, making a Missouri venue equally burdensome.
  
  III. Legal Standard
  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), this Court may transfer a case for the convenience of the parties and witnesses, and in the interest of justice. Factors to consider include:
  1. The convenience of the parties and witnesses;
  2. Access to sources of proof;
  3. The plaintiff’s choice of forum;
  4. Practical challenges of conducting the trial in the chosen forum;
  5. Local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.
  
  IV. Argument
  1. Convenience of the Parties:
     - Both parties reside in Kansas and would face significant hardship traveling to Missouri for court appearances. Transferring the case to Kansas reduces logistical burdens for both.
  2. Convenience of Witnesses:
     - Both parties’ families and potential witnesses reside in Kansas, minimizing travel for them and ensuring better participation.
  3. Access to Evidence:
     - Relevant evidence, such as Felix’s school records and community ties, is more readily available in Kansas.
  4. Local Interest:
     - Kansas has a strong local interest in adjudicating this matter, as both parties and their child reside and participate in the Kansas community.
  5. Interest of Justice:
     - Transferring the case aligns with fairness, reduces financial and logistical hardships, and supports the co-parenting relationship.
  
  V. Conclusion
  For the reasons stated, I, Michael Salmon, respectfully request that this Court transfer venue of this case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses.`

  1. Denial of Petition for Paternity:
     Respondent admits that he is the biological father of the minor child, Felix Salmon, and denies the need for a paternity determination as no dispute exists regarding parentage.
  
  2. Denial of Petition for Custody and Visitation:
     Respondent has been the primary caregiver for Felix for the past two years. Felix has a stable home with Respondent, including a routine and environment that is in his best interests. Respondent denies that any change in custody or visitation is appropriate.
     a. Respondent is concerned about the living conditions at Petitioner’s home, which is unsanitary and unsafe for Felix, as detailed in prior filings.
     b. Felix’s current living situation with Respondent is stable, healthy, and has been beneficial for his emotional and physical well-being.
  
  3. Denial of Petition for Child Support:
     Respondent denies that Crycella Freitag is entitled to child support at this time. Respondent has been the primary financial provider for Felix, and Petitioner has not contributed financially to Felix’s care or well-being despite multiple requests.
     Respondent is open to a discussion of a fair financial arrangement but asserts that he has borne the majority of the financial responsibility for Felix’s upbringing.
  
  WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that the Court:

      date: "2024-12-16",
      type: "Answer",
      status: "Granted",
      content: `COMES NOW the Respondent, Michael Lawrence Salmon, and responds to the Emergency Motion for Temporary Custody filed by the Petitioner, Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, in the above-captioned matter. In support of this response, Respondent states as follows:
  
  1. Primary Custody:
     Respondent has been the primary caregiver for the minor child, Felix Salmon, for the past two years. During this time, Felix has developed a stable routine and schedule with Respondent, which has been crucial to his well-being and development.
  
  2. Concerns Regarding Petitioner’s Home:
     Respondent has significant concerns about the living conditions at Petitioner’s home. Specifically:
     a. Felix will not have his own room at Petitioner’s house, unlike the safe and private space he has at Respondent’s home.
     b. Petitioner’s home is shared with seven dogs and seven cats, and it has been reported that the home is covered in pet waste, creating an unsanitary and potentially unsafe environment for a child.
     c. Respondent has been denied the opportunity to clean or make necessary improvements to ensure the environment is safe for Felix, despite offering to do so.
  
  3. Request for Safe Environment:
     Respondent respectfully requests that the Court ensure any visitation or custody arrangement take into account Felix’s health and safety, and that Petitioner be required to demonstrate that her living environment is safe, clean, and appropriate for a young child. Respondent requests that Felix continue to reside with him, as he has been the primary caregiver and has a stable, safe, and nurturing home for Felix.
  
  4. Financial Responsibility:
     Respondent has been solely responsible for Felix’s financial care, and Petitioner has not contributed financially to his upbringing, despite requests. This further demonstrates Respondent’s role as Felix’s primary caregiver.
  
  WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that the Court:

  Subject: Formal Complaint Against Joshua L. Garrett
  From: Michael Lawrence Salmon
  Address: 4120 Adams St, Kansas City, Kansas 66103
  Date: December 16, 2024
  
  Introduction:
  I am filing a formal complaint against attorney Joshua L. Garrett for unethical professional conduct in his representation of my ex-partner, Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, in our ongoing child custody matter concerning our son, Felix Salmon.
  
  Specific Instances of Misconduct:
  1. Deliberate Obstruction of Co-Parenting Communication:
     - In November 2024, Mr. Garrett advised Crycella to cease all communication with me, which resulted in:
       a. Complete cessation of discussions about Felix's care and upbringing.
       b. Refusal to provide financial information related to our child's support.
       c. Intentional withholding of critical parenting and residential information.
     - This advice has systematically undermined my ability to co-parent effectively and share responsibilities for our child's well-being.
  
  2. Facilitation of Manipulative Communication Tactics:
     - Following Mr. Garrett's advice, our interactions have devolved into:
       a. Intentionally confrontational exchanges.
       b. Calculated attempts to provoke or entrap me.
       c. Deliberate creation of a hostile communication environment.
  
  3. Enabling False Safety Claims:
     - A particularly egregious incident occurred when Crycella claimed to feel "unsafe" while:
       a. Voluntarily present in my home.
       b. Situated in my bedroom.
       c. In the presence of our children.
     - When I sought clarification about this sudden claim, she refused to provide any substantive explanation. This baseless allegation appears designed to:
       a. Damage my reputation as a parent.
       b. Undermine my relationship with our children.
       c. Weaponize unfounded safety concerns.
  
  4. Pattern of Racial Weaponization:
     - This is not an isolated incident. Previously, Crycella attempted to:
       a. Take Felix across state lines without my knowledge or consent.
       b. Involve law enforcement with fabricated claims of danger.
       c. Leverage her position as a white woman to potentially harm my parental rights as a Black father.
     - Mr. Garrett's continued legal counsel appears to tacitly encourage and enable these harmful tactics.
  
  Violations of Professional Ethics:
  I believe Mr. Garrett has violated multiple professional conduct rules:
  1. Rule 4.4 – Respect for Rights of Third Persons:
     - Providing advice that disregards the well-being of our child.
     - Causing significant harm to co-parental communication.
  2. Rule 1.2 – Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority:
     - Advising client to cease essential communication.
     - Actions directly contrary to the best interests of the minor child.
  3. Rule 8.4 – Misconduct:
     - Engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.
     - Promoting tactics involving false allegations and manipulation.
  
  Impact on Family Dynamics:
  The consequences of Mr. Garrett's unethical guidance include:
  1. Emotional distress for our child, Felix.
  2. Systematic destruction of co-parental communication.
  3. Potential long-term psychological harm from persistent conflict.
  
  Requested Action:
  I formally request that the Bar Association:
  1. Thoroughly investigate Mr. Garrett's professional conduct.
  2. Consider appropriate disciplinary measures.
  3. Mandate cessation of tactics that obstruct meaningful co-parenting.
  
  Conclusion:
  As the primary goal of any custody arrangement should be the child's best interest, Mr. Garrett's actions have systematically undermined this fundamental principle. I trust the Bar Association will take these serious allegations seriously and take appropriate action.`

      date: "2024-16-12",
      type: "Answer",
      status: "Overruled",
      content: `COMES NOW the Respondent, Michael Lawrence Salmon, and responds to the Petition for Paternity, Custody, Visitation, and Child Support filed by Crycella Elizabeth Freitag. In support of this response, Respondent states as follows:
  
  1. Denial of Petition for Paternity:
     Respondent admits that he is the biological father of the minor child, Felix Salmon, and denies the need for a paternity determination as no dispute exists regarding parentage.
  
  2. Denial of Petition for Custody and Visitation:
     Respondent has been the primary caregiver for Felix for the past two years. Felix has a stable home with Respondent, including a routine and environment that is in his best interests. Respondent denies that any change in custody or visitation is appropriate.
     a. Respondent is concerned about the living conditions at Petitioner’s home, which is unsanitary and unsafe for Felix, as detailed in prior filings.
     b. Felix’s current living situation with Respondent is stable, healthy, and has been beneficial for his emotional and physical well-being.
  
  3. Denial of Petition for Child Support:
     Respondent denies that Crycella Freitag is entitled to child support at this time. Respondent has been the primary financial provider for Felix, and Petitioner has not contributed financially to Felix’s care or well-being despite multiple requests.
     Respondent is open to a discussion of a fair financial arrangement but asserts that he has borne the majority of the financial responsibility for Felix’s upbringing.
  
  WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that the Court:
  1. Deny the Petition for Paternity, Custody, Visitation, and Child Support filed by Petitioner, Crycella Elizabeth Freitag.
  2. Grant primary custody of Felix Salmon to Respondent, Michael Lawrence Salmon.
  3. Order visitation for the Petitioner, if any, to be arranged in a way that is in the best interests of Felix and ensures his safety and well-being.
  4. Deny the Petition for Child Support from Petitioner, as Respondent has been the primary financial caregiver for Felix.`

    content: `Witness Name: Jozef Hanratty\r\nAddress: 4120 Adams St, Kansas City, Kansas 66103\r\nCOMES NOW the undersigned, Jozef Hanratty, and provides this witness statement regarding\r\nthe interactions and behavior of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards Michael Lawrence Salmon.\r\nThe following statements are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief:\r\nGaslighting Behavior\r\n1. On several occasions, I heard Crycella Elizabeth Freitag state to Michael Lawrence\r\nSalmon:\r\n? "You don’t have the right to know anything about me, my finances, or where I\r\nwant to take Felix."\r\n? "You don’t need to know where Felix stays, and I don’t need to show you pictures\r\nof our time together."\r\n\r\n2. These statements were made in a dismissive and confrontational tone, seemingly\r\nintended to belittle Michael and undermine his valid concerns about Felix's well-being.\r\nOmission of Critical Information\r\n1. Crycella Elizabeth Freitag explicitly refused to provide Michael with vital information\r\nabout her finances and Felix’s care, stating:\r\n? "No, until I get what I want, you won’t get any help from me."\r\n2. Furthermore, she accused Michael of making her feel "unsafe" without providing any\r\nexplanation or justification for these claims.\r\nLying and Interruptions\r\n1. I observed Crycella frequently interrupting Michael during discussions, accusing him of\r\nlying and refusing to listen to his responses.\r\n2. Despite these interruptions, Michael remained calm and transparent in his\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nTransparency and Hospitality by Michael Lawrence Salmon\r\n1. Michael invited Crycella into his home and maintained open communication to facilitate\r\nco-parenting and transparency.\r\n2. Despite his efforts, Crycella continued her dismissive and uncooperative behavior.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on my observations, the behavior exhibited by Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards\r\nMichael Lawrence Salmon was manipulative, dismissive, and designed to escalate tension\r\nunnecessarily. I attest to witnessing the above-described events and am prepared to provide\r\nadditional information or testimony as required.`

    content: `Witness Name: Anya Hill\r\nAddress: Resides with Crycella Freitag\r\nCOMES NOW, the undersigned, Anya Hill, and provides this witness statement regarding the\r\ninteractions and behavior of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards Micheal Lawrence Salmon, as\r\nobserved by me during the past few years. Although I am only 12 years old, I have lived with\r\nMicheal for the last seven years and have witnessed much of what has occurred. The following\r\nis true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief:\r\n1. Relationship with Micheal Lawrence Salmon:\r\n? While Micheal is not my biological father, he has been a significant figure in my\r\nlife for the last seven years. He has always been there for me in a supportive and\r\ncaring way, helping me with school, providing for me, and offering guidance when\r\nI needed it.\r\n? He has made efforts to be involved in my life, and I have always appreciated his\r\nsupport. Although I do not consider him my \"father\" in the legal sense, I do see\r\nhim as a positive male role model and someone who has always treated me with\r\nkindness and respect.\r\n\r\n2. Observations of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag:\r\n? I have noticed that Crycella frequently speaks negatively about Todd Hill, my\r\nbiological father, in front of me. This makes me uncomfortable, as it seems like\r\nshe is trying to turn me against him. I don�t like hearing these comments, as they\r\nonly make me feel conflicted and upset.\r\n? Crycella has also discouraged me from having a positive relationship with\r\nMicheal, even though he has always treated me well. On several occasions, she\r\nhas dismissed my feelings when I express how much I appreciate Micheal�s\r\nsupport in my life.\r\n\r\n3. Disagreement and Combative Behavior:\r\n? Crycella often becomes combative when I express positive things about Micheal,\r\nwhich makes me feel like I can�t talk freely about my own experiences. If I\r\nmention that I feel comfortable with him or that he has been helpful to me, she\r\ngets upset and tries to change the subject or criticize him.\r\n\r\n? This has made it difficult for me to maintain a healthy and open relationship with\r\nMicheal. I know he has always been there for me, but Crycella�s behavior\r\ninterferes with that.\r\n\r\n4. The Role of Micheal Lawrence Salmon in My Life:\r\n? While he is not my legal father, Micheal has always been there to offer support\r\nand care. He�s made sure I had what I needed, and he has been involved in my\r\nlife when I needed him. He has helped me with schoolwork, been present for\r\nimportant events, and has always shown me kindness.\r\n? I wish I could see Micheal more often and without Crycella�s interference. He has\r\nalways tried to be a positive influence in my life, and I believe he cares for me,\r\neven though we don�t have a traditional father-daughter relationship.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nBased on my observations, Micheal has been a caring and supportive person in my life.\r\nCrycella�s behavior has often made it difficult for me to maintain a positive relationship with him,\r\nand I believe that her treatment of him has been unfair. Additionally, I feel uncomfortable with\r\nthe negative things she says about my biological father, Todd Hill, as it has created unnecessary\r\ntension. I wish that I could freely express my feelings without fear of upsetting Crycella.`

    content: `PARENTING TIME LOG\r\nDate: Thursday, December 26, 2024\r\nInteraction:\r\n? Asked Crycella when she would like to see Felix again. After three hours of arguing, she\r\nchose Saturday but refused to provide an itinerary.\r\n? Expressed concerns regarding supervision and requested a chaperone for future visits\r\ndue to a prior incident where Felix returned cold and shaking after being outside for over\r\nfour hours in inappropriate clothing. Crycella refused to agree to any supervision or\r\nprovide photos of Felix at events.\r\nDate: Friday, December 27, 2024\r\nInteraction:\r\n? Received no updates from Crycella regarding Saturday plans as promised.\r\nDate: Saturday, December 28, 2024\r\nInteraction:\r\n? 8:00 AM: Contacted Crycella to confirm her plans to see Felix. She stated she still had\r\nno specific plans and could not provide any details.\r\n? 8:30 AM: Informed Crycella she could have Felix from 3:00 PM until bedtime and\r\nexplained that if she did not show up, it would be her responsibility. She agreed to this\r\narrangement and again told me it was because of her broken car.\r\nImpact:\r\n1. Lost opportunity for personal time with friends due to last-minute planning changes.\r\n2. Missed potential side jobs, resulting in lost income opportunities critical as a single\r\nfather.\r\n3. Created unnecessary stress and uncertainty for Felix due to Crycella�s lack of reliability.\r\nConclusion\r\nCrycella�s repeated failure to provide clear plans and her reliance on transportation issues as an\r\nexcuse has significantly impacted my ability to plan my life and care for Felix. Her inconsistent\r\nvisitation and lack of accountability place undue strain on me as a single father and affect Felix�s\r\nemotional well-being.\r\n\r\nI am prepared to provide further details or testimony to support this log.`

    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Petitioner, and respectfully moves this Court for a\r\nchange of judge pursuant to Rule 51.05 of the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure. In support of\r\nthis motion, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n1. The presiding judge, Honorable Judge Matt Alan Selby, has demonstrated bias and\r\nprejudice against Petitioner by refusing to review key evidence, including lease\r\nagreements and supporting text messages.\r\n2. Judge Selby has allowed knowingly false testimony from witnesses, affecting the\r\nfairness of the custody proceedings.\r\n3. Judge Selby�s failure to consider relevant evidence has led to an unjust ruling that is not\r\nin the best interest of the minor child.\r\n4. Missouri law entitles litigants to a fair and impartial judge, and Petitioner believes Judge\r\nSelby�s actions indicate an inability to render an unbiased decision.\r\n5.

Introduction\r\nThis Motion is brought to ensure the welfare and safety of Felix Salmon by establishing clear\r\ncommunication protocols between the parties regarding his care, health, and activities during\r\nPetitioner�s parenting time.\r\nII. Factual Basis\r\n1. Failure to Provide Necessary Information\r\n? During Felix�s recent visit with Petitioner, he returned to Respondent exhibiting\r\nsymptoms of vomiting and illness.

Ongoing Communication Issues\r\n? Petitioner has consistently refused to communicate effectively or provide timely\r\nand accurate information regarding Felix�s well-being. This includes:\r\n? Failing to notify Respondent of activities or locations during her parenting\r\ntime.\r\n? Refusing to answer questions regarding Felix�s diet, health, or exposure\r\nto unsafe environments.\r\n? Creating unnecessary stress and instability for Felix due to lack of\r\ncooperation and transparency.\r\n3. Pattern of Neglect and Poor Co-Parenting\r\n?

Plaintiff further requests this Court impose sanctions against\r\nDefendant Joshua Garrett for his deliberate role in misleading the Court and obstructing justice.\r\nIn support of this motion, Plaintiff states as follows:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nPlaintiff has been subjected to fraudulent testimony and unethical legal maneuvers that have\r\ndeprived him of his parental rights and inflicted significant financial and emotional harm. This\r\nmotion seeks urgent relief by requesting the immediate reversal of the unjust custody order and\r\nfinancial sanctions against Defendant Joshua Garrett for his misconduct in these proceedings.\r\nFurthermore, Plaintiff explicitly informed Judge Matt Alan Selby during the hearing that he\r\npossessed a contradictory lease agreement and supporting text messages disproving the false\r\nclaims made by Defendants.

UNETHICAL CONDUCT AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE BY JOSHUA GARRETT\r\n1.

Garrett conspired with Jozef Hanratty and Crycella Freitag to fabricate a crisis, leading to\r\nan emergency custody order on December 3, 2024, based on false pretenses.\r\n3. Garrett deliberately obstructed Plaintiff�s ability to respond to legal actions by refusing to\r\ncommunicate via email and relying on postal mail to delay essential court\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n4. Garrett actively pressured Plaintiff�s landlord to remove him from his residence,\r\nmanufacturing instability to be used against Plaintiff in custody proceedings.\r\nC.

Defendants colluded to manipulate custody proceedings through perjury and falsified\r\nclaims, directly harming Plaintiff�s parental rights.\r\n2. As a result of Defendants� fraudulent actions, Plaintiff has suffered:\r\n? Unjustified loss of custody and parental time.\r\n? Severe financial hardship, including loss of internet access essential for work\r\nand legal proceedings.\r\n?

Falsely stating that I must pay for a full transcript at an inflated rate ($3.50 per page,\r\ntotaling over $1,000) despite the availability of alternative means under Rule 81.12(c).\r\n? Demanding an uncertain \"deposit\" without disclosing how final costs are determined,\r\nmaking it impossible to budget or plan for the appeal.\r\n? Withholding information on cost waivers and alternative documentation that could allow\r\nme to proceed without an excessive financial burden.\r\nThese actions directly contradict Missouri�s established appellate procedures and constitute an\r\nabuse of administrative discretion.\r\n3. Improper Handling of My Appeal Filing\r\n? Ms. Lacy has delayed and obstructed my appeal by failing to promptly process my\r\nNotice of Appeal and attaching unnecessary financial conditions before forwarding my\r\ncase to the Missouri Court of Appeals.\r\n? She has refused to provide clear guidance on the accepted means of payment for the\r\nappeal filing fee, further delaying my ability to move forward.\r\n4. Acting Outside the Scope of Her Duties\r\nThe role of a clerk is ministerial�meaning clerks must process filings according to procedural\r\nrules without imposing additional conditions that are not required by law. Ms. Lacy is\r\n\r\nimproperly inserting herself into judicial decision-making by wrongfully interpreting appellate\r\nrules and creating conditions that prevent me from filing in a fair and timely manner.\r\nRequested Actions & Remedies\r\nGiven the above violations, I request the following:\r\n1. A formal investigation into Ms. Lacy�s conduct, including a review of whether she\r\nhas similarly obstructed other pro se litigants.\r\n2. Immediate processing of my Notice of Appeal without unlawful financial barriers.\r\n3. Clarification on the use of a Statement of Evidence in lieu of a transcript, per Rule\r\n81.12(c), to ensure compliance with appellate procedures.\r\n4. Disciplinary action against Ms. Lacy for administrative misconduct if it is found that\r\nshe has intentionally misrepresented legal requirements.\r\nFailure to address this misconduct will leave me with no choice but to escalate this matter to\r\nhigher judicial oversight bodies, including the Missouri Commission on Retirement,\r\nRemoval, and Discipline of Judges, and to pursue legal remedies to enforce my right to due\r\nprocess.\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request a written response detailing the\r\nsteps being taken to address these concerns.`

    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Salmon, Petitioner, and submits the following evidence and motion to formally tie Kelly Truelove to the present case, document procedural manipulation, and highlight judicial oversight regarding perjury committed by Jozef Hanratty and Attorney Joshua Garrett. In support of this motion, Petitioner states as follows: 1. Evidence Submission: Notice to Pay or Quit from Kelly Truelove ● Petitioner received a "Notice to Pay or Quit for Non-Payment of Rent" from Kelly's legal counsel. ● This notice is the first form of communication received from her, despite Petitioner's multiple attempts to arrange payment, which have been systematically obstructed. ● The notice states that April will be the final month of tenancy but fails to specify the exact amount owed, demonstrating bad-faith intent rather than an attempt to resolve the matter. ● The notice also declares that legal action will begin on April 1st, aligning with Petitioner's preparation to file in Kansas, where proper jurisdiction exists. 2. Procedural Manipulation and Inclusion of Kelly Truelove ● Kelly Truelove has intentionally delayed communications and manipulated circumstances to gain an unfair advantage in litigation. ● Given that housing and financial stability are directly relevant to this custody case, her involvement is critical and should be officially acknowledged by the court. ● The court should note her role in strategically delaying payments and controlling financial leverage to influence ongoing legal proceedings unfairly.  3. Judicial Error & Perjury by Jozef Hanratty and Joshua Garrett ● Jozef Hanratty provided knowingly false testimony, which has been acknowledged as false by the court but was still used to justify an unfavorable temporary order. ● Attorney Joshua Garrett has facilitated this perjury and has misrepresented facts before the court. ● The judge’s failure to act on this perjury while continuing to enforce orders based on knowingly false testimony constitutes a clear legal oversight and miscarriage of justice. ● Petitioner requests that the court formally address these infractions and reconsider rulings that have been improperly influenced by false testimony. 4. Relief Requested Petitioner respectfully requests the following actions be taken: 1. Formally include Kelly Truelove as a relevant party to this case, given her demonstrated impact on Petitioner's financial stability and living situation. 2. Acknowledge and rectify the judicial oversight that has allowed perjury by Jozef Hanratty and misrepresentation by Joshua Garrett to affect prior rulings. 3. Reevaluate all temporary custody orders that were based on false statements and manipulated evidence. 4. Allow Petitioner to submit all relevant financial records and prior communication attempts as evidence of Kelly Truelove’s manipulative tactics in this case.`

    title: "PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS",
    date: "2025-18-2",
    type: "Petition",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a Writ of Mandamus directing the Honorable MATT ALAN SELBY, Circuit Judge of Stone County, Missouri, to:\r\nPerform his mandatory duty to rule on pending motions and address legal errors;\r\nVacate all orders issued under improper jurisdiction;\r\nTransfer this matter to the appropriate Kansas court under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA); and\r\nRestore Petitioner�s parental rights and enforce proper visitation with his son, Felix Salmon.\r\nIn support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis case presents a clear failure by the Stone County Circuit Court to perform its mandatory duties under the law. The presiding judge has:\r\nFailed to rule on multiple motions filed by Petitioner, including motions to dismiss for improper venue and motions to transfer jurisdiction under the UCCJEA; It is well-established that a trial court has a non-discretionary duty to rule on properly filed motions. See State ex rel. Jones v. McGhee, 639 S.W.2d 60 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982) (holding that a judge must rule on pending motions within a reasonable time). Failure to do so constitutes a denial of due process, warranting mandamus relief.\r\nMaintained jurisdiction over this case despite clear evidence that Stone County, Missouri, lacks jurisdiction;\r\nAllowed the Real Party in Interest, Crycella Freitag, to repeatedly violate court-ordered visitation and alienate Petitioner from his son;\r\nAllowed procedural misconduct that has placed Petitioner at a severe disadvantage, effectively denying him due process.\r\nThis Court must intervene to correct these injustices and ensure that legal procedures are followed.\r\nII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\r\nA. Improper Jurisdiction and Venue\r\nFelix Salmon resided in Stone County, Missouri, for less than six months (May 17, 2024 � November 13, 2024). Under RSMo � 452.700 and K.S.A. 23-37,201, jurisdiction vests in the state where the child has resided for six consecutive months immediately preceding the commencement of the action. Felix did not meet this threshold in Stone County. Wyandotte County is the only legitimate claim to jurisdiction, rendering the orders of the Stone County Circuit Court void ab initio.\r\nPursuant to the UCCJEA (RSMo � 452.700 et seq.), jurisdiction is proper only where the child has lived for six consecutive months prior to legal action.\r\nBoth parents currently reside in Kansas, making Kansas the appropriate forum for this case under the UCCJEA.\r\nCrycella Freitag engaged in jurisdictional manipulation by delaying separation and creating a temporary residence in Stone County Missouri to fabricate a legal basis for venue.\r\nB. Judge�s Failure to Address Motions\r\nPetitioner has filed multiple motions, including:\r\nMotion to Dismiss for Improper Venue;\r\nMotion to Transfer Jurisdiction to Kansas;\r\nMotion to Enforce Visitation;\r\nMotion for Protection of Minor Witness from Undue Influence (For my daughter Anya, whom I have raised for seven years and have not seen for three months);\r\nMotion for Emergency Relief (Documented three instances where Crycella has been unsafe with Felix, addressing direct concerns regarding his safety);\r\nMotion for Communication Order (Petitioner had to disclose all information in interrogatories, whereas Crycella was able to withhold critical information, including her financial obligations and residency);\r\nMotion to Sanction Petitioner and Petitioner�s Counsel for Unethical and Obstructive Conduct (Addressing misconduct by Mr. Garrett);\r\nMotion to Issue Subpoena for Minor Witness Testimony (Attempted to obtain testimony from Anya before further manipulation by Crycella);\r\nMotion for Home Inspection and Financial Disclosure (Petitioner has been denied any information regarding Felix's living conditions, has not been allowed to inspect his sleeping arrangements, and has been left without knowledge while Crycella retains access to Petitioner�s home).\r\nThe judge has failed to rule on these motions, leaving Petitioner without recourse and violating his right to due process. The United States Supreme Court has long held that 'The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.' Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). The failure to rule on pending motions deprives Petitioner of this right, necessitating intervention from this Court.\r\nC. Denial of Visitation and Parental Rights\r\nThe judge granted Petitioner only up to two hours of supervised visitation on Saturdays up to Crycella�s discretion.\r\nCrycella Freitag has repeatedly denied visitation in violation of court orders.\r\nFelix is currently living in a household with eight people and 14 animals, raising concerns about his well-being and stability.\r\nCrycella Freitag has refused to allow Petitioner�s family and friends access to Felix, further alienating him from his support network.\r\nD. Intentional Financial Hardship Created by Crycella Freitag\r\nCrycella Freitag has failed to contribute financially to Felix�s care.\r\nShe has engaged in legal maneuvers intended to drain Petitioner�s financial resources, forcing him to proceed pro se.\r\nThe court's failure to address these issues has compounded the prejudice against Petitioner.\r\nIII. LEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nA. Failure to Perform Mandatory Duties\r\nA trial court has a mandatory duty to rule on properly filed motions. The failure to do so deprives Petitioner of his constitutional right to due process.\r\nB. Violation of the UCCJEA\r\nThe UCCJEA (RSMo � 452.700 et seq.) mandates that jurisdiction is proper where the child has lived for six consecutive months. Felix has not met this threshold in Missouri, making the continued assertion of jurisdiction by Stone County a clear legal error.\r\nC. Clear Abuse of Discretion\r\nThe judge's refusal to transfer jurisdiction despite the clear mandates of the UCCJEA constitutes an abuse of discretion.\r\nD. No Adequate Remedy at Law\r\nPetitioner has exhausted all available legal remedies, filing multiple motions that remain unanswered. The lack of court action leaves Petitioner with no adequate legal remedy other than this writ.\r\nIV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nIssue a Writ of Mandamus directing the Honorable MATT ALAN SELBY to:\r\na) Rule on all pending motions within 14 days;\r\nb) Vacate all orders issued in excess of jurisdiction; and\r\nc) Transfer this matter to Kansas in accordance with the UCCJEA.\r\nRestore Petitioner�s parental rights and enforce meaningful visitation with Felix Salmon.\r\nStay enforcement of any orders granting sole custody to Crycella Freitag pending resolution of this writ.\r\nGrant Petitioner�s request for a fee waiver (see below).\r\nCivil Rights Violations under 42 U.S.C. � 1983\r\nJudge Selby's deliberate failure to rule on motions and enforce parental rights\r\nConstitutional violations of due process\r\nDeprivation of parental rights under color of law These violations can yield significant damages, including punitive damages against state actors\r\nTort Claims Against Opposing Party\r\nIntentional infliction of emotional distress\r\nFraudulent misrepresentation to establish jurisdiction\r\nParental alienation \r\nBad faith litigation\r\nAll therapy/counseling costs related to separation from Felix\r\nRealized Damages Documentation (will be provided)\r\nLost wages from improper venue\r\nTravel expenses\r\nLegal costs\r\nLost business opportunities\r\nProperty access denial\r\nHealthcare access denial\r\nInterference with Parent-Child Relationship\r\nEvery denied visitation with monetary value\r\nImpact on Felix's relationship with siblings\r\nLoss of parental companionship\r\nEducational decision-making interference\r\nV. REQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests a fee waiver for the filing of this petition. Petitioner is currently experiencing financial hardship and lacks the resources to pay the filing fee. A fee waiver is necessary to ensure access to justice.\r\nVI. CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court grant the Writ of Mandamus and provide the relief requested.`

    content: `I, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, being duly sworn, state as follows:\r\nIntroduction\r\nI am the Respondent/Counter-Petitioner in the above-captioned matter.\r\nResidency of Felix Salmon\r\nFelix Salmon resided in Stone County, Missouri, for less than six months�from May 17, 2024, to November 13, 2024.\r\nLack of Significant Connection to Stone County\r\nAt the time this case was filed, neither parent had any significant connection to Stone County. Neither I nor Crycella Freitag have any meaningful ties to Stone County. We have no family, no friends, and no community connections in the area. The fact that our witnesses had to drive over four hours to attend court proceedings further demonstrates the lack of any substantial connection to the jurisdiction.\r\nDeceptive Statements by Petitioner\r\nThe only reason Felix remained in Stone County beyond what was necessary was due to deceptive statements made by Petitioner/Counter-Respondent, Crycella Freitag.\r\nExhibit I: Text Messages\r\nAttached as Exhibit I are text messages from Crycella Freitag, in which she:\r\nEncouraged me to remain in Branson, despite having no intention of living with me.\r\nGave false assurances about our cohabitation, despite admitting in court that she had lost romantic interest and moved out permanently.\r\nDeliberately attempted to influence my residency to create a false claim to Stone County as a proper venue.\r\nThese messages demonstrate that Petitioner/Counter-Respondent and her legal counsel manipulated the legal process in bad faith to establish an improper venue.\r\nCurrent Residency and Jurisdiction\r\nBoth parties now reside in Kansas. Missouri no longer has a continuing jurisdictional basis under the UCCJEA. Even if Missouri originally had jurisdiction, Stone County was an improper venue due to fraud and misrepresentation.\r\nUnfair Treatment by the Court\r\nThroughout these proceedings, the court has treated me unfairly in the following ways:\r\nPerjury by Petitioner: The court has ignored clear evidence of perjury by Crycella Freitag, and her witness Jozef Hanratty including her false statements about her intentions to cohabitate, housing instability, and her deliberate misrepresentation of facts to establish jurisdiction in Stone County.\r\nIgnoring Motions: The judge has consistently ignored or denied all motions filed by me, including motions to dismiss for improper venue and motions to transfer jurisdiction to Kansas.\r\nArbitrary Civil Arguments: The judge has allowed arbitrary civil arguments that are irrelevant to the custody determination, including arguments about my residency and financial status, which have no bearing on the best interests of Felix.\r\nBias and Prejudice: The judge has demonstrated bias and prejudice by consistently ruling in favor of the Petitioner without proper consideration of the evidence or the law.\r\nFailure to Address Fraud: The court has failed to address the fraud and misrepresentation committed by the Petitioner, which has resulted in an improper venue and a miscarriage of justice.\r\nDenial of Visitation: The judge�s order granting me only two hours of visitation on Saturdays was already excessively restrictive and not in the best interests of Felix. However, Crycella Freitag has denied even this limited visitation, further alienating me from my child.\r\nIsolation from Family and Friends: Crycella Freitag has also refused to allow my friends and family to see Felix, effectively isolating him from his extended support network. This is not only unfair to me but also detrimental to Felix�s well-being and emotional development.\r\nRequest for Relief\r\nThis Court must vacate all orders and transfer this matter to the appropriate Kansas court.\r\n\r\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\r\n\r\nExhibit I Link: https://tinyurl.com/yt268ns3`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `MOTION TO OBJECT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION BY RESPONDENT'S SELECTED PSYCHOLOGIST AND TO REASSERT OBJECTIONS TO PRIOR UNADDRESSED ISSUES\r\nCOMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to reject the\r\npsychological evaluation to be conducted by Susan K Vandeusen, who has been selected by\r\nRespondent, and to instead appoint a neutral, court-approved evaluator. Additionally, Petitioner\r\nseeks to formally reassert prior objections which have been ignored in these proceedings. In\r\nsupport thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n\r\nI. OBJECTION TO RESPONDENT'S SELECTED\r\nPSYCHOLOGIST\r\n1. The Evaluator Lacks Neutrality and Presents a Conflict of Interest\r\n1. The appointed psychologist, Susan K Vandeusen, was personally selected by\r\nRespondent, rather than being a neutral evaluator appointed by the Court.\r\n2. It is in the best interest of the child, Felix Salmon, that any psychological evaluation be\r\nconducted by a neutral, court-appointed forensic psychologist, rather than a\r\nprofessional with a potential bias toward one parent.\r\n3. Susan K Vandeusen has no verifiable history of conducting forensic custody\r\nevaluations and lacks publicly available records or professional reviews, raising\r\nconcerns about their credibility.\r\n1\r\n\r\n2. The Appointment of a Neutral Evaluator Ensures Fairness\r\n4. Petitioner respectfully requests that, should a psychological evaluation be deemed\r\nnecessary, the Court appoint a licensed, neutral forensic psychologist with a proven\r\nrecord of unbiased custody evaluations.\r\n5. A neutral evaluator ensures fairness and prevents undue influence from either party in the\r\ncustody proceedings.\r\n3. Due Process and Fair Treatment\r\n6. The appointment of a neutral forensic evaluator is consistent with the principles of due\r\nprocess and fairness in family court proceedings.\r\n7. The Court has a duty to ensure that both parties are treated equally in any\r\npsychological evaluations that may impact custody determinations.\r\n\r\nII. REASSERTION OF PRIOR OBJECTIONS\r\n4. Unaddressed Objections Demonstrating Systemic Bias\r\n8. Petitioner has previously filed motions and objections regarding:\r\n? The unilateral acceptance of Respondent�s requests while Petitioner�s filings\r\nare ignored.\r\n? The failure to acknowledge Petitioner�s evidence regarding financial support,\r\nFelix�s residency history, and the Respondent�s lack of financial contribution.\r\n? The denial of Petitioner�s ability to conduct discovery, including the\r\nopportunity to submit interrogatories and obtain key financial and medical\r\nrecords.\r\n? The failure to address the jurisdictional argument that Felix has resided in\r\nWyandotte County for the majority of his life, making this the proper venue.\r\n? The lack of enforcement against Respondent�s repeated refusals to provide\r\nfinancial support, while Petitioner has been solely responsible for childcare and\r\nliving expenses.\r\n5. Pattern of Procedural Imbalance\r\n9. The Court�s pattern of denying or ignoring Petitioner�s motions while granting\r\nRespondent�s requests is creating an unfair procedural imbalance.\r\n10. The failure to consider evidence, grant basic discovery rights, and apply equal\r\nstandards raises serious concerns about judicial impartiality.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\n1. Reject the evaluation by Susan K Vandeusen due to the potential conflict of interest.\r\n2. Appoint a neutral, court-approved forensic psychologist to conduct any required\r\nevaluations.\r\n3. Address and rule on Petitioner�s prior objections, which have been repeatedly\r\nignored.\r\n4. Ensure equal consideration of both parties' filings and motions.\r\n5. Grant any further relief this Court deems just and proper.`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `Motion for Sanctions Against Mr. Garrett and Crycella Freitag\r\n(Re-filing motion to preserve the issue for appeal) Counter-Petitioner respectfully objects to the Court�s ruling on temporary custody order. Mr. Garrett and Crycella Freitag have repeatedly engaged in bad faith litigation tactics, including perjury, obstruction of justice, and racial bias, despite being warned of the consequences. His actions have caused significant financial, emotional, and psychological harm to Counter-Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and have directly interfered with Micheal�s ability to maintain a relationship with his son, Felix. Specifically:\r\nPerjury and False Testimony: Mr. Garrett called witnesses who knowingly committed perjury, including Crycella, who made false statements under oath (e.g., �Micheal is unstable,� �I�m scared of him,� �Micheal yells at the Judge�). These claims are contradicted by video evidence.\r\nObstruction of Justice: Mr. Garrett coached Crycella in emotional manipulation, as evidenced by his repeated statements such as, �Watch his reaction.� He knowingly allowed this abuse of process to continue for weeks.\r\nUnfair Custody Arrangement: Mr. Garrett requested a biased and unfair custody arrangement that was not in the best interest of Felix and was based on false and inflammatory statements.\r\nWeaponization of the Legal System: Crycella repeatedly made false allegations to law enforcement and the court, including claims that Micheal is �unsafe� or �needs mental help,� without providing any evidence.\r\nRacial Bias: The court's conduct demonstrates a pattern of racial bias, as they consistently undermined the credibility and evidence presented by the Black parent, while giving undue weight to the claims of the white parties involved.\r\nCase Law:\r\nChambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991): Courts have inherent authority to impose sanctions for bad-faith conduct, including abusive litigation tactics.\r\nRoadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752 (1980): Courts can sanction attorneys and parties for misconduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.\r\nShepherd v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 62 F.3d 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1995): Sanctions are appropriate for deliberate deception or obstruction of justice.\r\n\r\nRequested Relief:\r\nLost Work and Time: Award Counter-Petitioner $10,000 for lost work and time directly resulting from the biased and bad-faith litigation tactics employed by the opposing party.\r\nDebt Owed:\r\nOrder the immediate payment of the full $90,000 debt owed to Counter-Petitioner, with complete financial transparency to ensure compliance.\r\nCompensatory Sanctions Against Josh Garrett:\r\nImpose sanctions on Josh Garrett in the amount of $60,000 to compensate Micheal Lawrence Salmon for the following:\r\nFinancial Losses: On January 30th, Micheal explicitly warned Mr. Garrett to cease his misconduct and review the evidence, citing $30,000 in damages at that time. Despite this warning, Mr. Garrett doubled down on his bad faith conduct by knowingly presenting false testimony, including the claim that Kelly Truelove verified Jozef Hanratty�s narrative, which is contradicted by the evidence.\r\nRelationship Damages: Mr. Garrett�s actions have directly interfered with Micheal�s ability to maintain a relationship with his son, Felix, causing irreparable harm and to his family who are following this case.\r\nEmotional Distress: Micheal has endured severe emotional and psychological harm as a result of Mr. Garrett�s misconduct, including the perpetuation of false claims and perjury.\r\nThe Court compels the disclosure of all communications between Mr. Garrett, Crycella Freitag, Amanda Freitag (and husband), Kelly Truelove, Stephanie Reed, Tyler Brown, Micheal�s family, and Jozef Hanratty regarding efforts to misrepresent evidence.\r\nThe Court considers the impact of Mr. Garrett�s fraudulent claims on prior rulings, including the temporary custody order, and takes corrective action to rectify any decisions influenced by falsified evidence and strike all false claims submitted as fact.`

    content: `The presiding judge has ruled against Counter-Petitioner multiple times despite clear evidence of perjury, obstruction, and misconduct by opposing counsel and related parties. A pattern of rulings suggests a lack of impartiality, requiring judicial review to ensure that future decisions are based solely on facts and law. The court has previously ignored or dismissed substantial evidence that directly contradicts claims made by Crycella Freitag and her legal team. The judge has failed to enforce accountability against those who have lied under oath, creating a prejudicial environment against Counter-Petitioner. Furthermore, given the pattern of adverse rulings and the clear appearance of judicial bias, Counter-Petitioner respectfully requests certification under Rule 51 for an immediate interlocutory appeal on the question of judicial bias.

Petitioner further requests an immediate hearing due to the urgent nature of this matter. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION AND EMERGENCY BASIS FOR HEARING\r\nPetitioner is the father of Felix Salmon, and the current custody arrangement, as ordered by this Court, is being weaponized by Respondent to intentionally destroy Petitioner�s relationship with his son.\r\nRespondent has repeatedly and willfully interfered with Petitioner�s court-ordered parenting time and communication with Felix, including but not limited to:\r\na. Hanging up on scheduled calls between Petitioner and Felix;\r\nb. Interrupting conversations, talking over Petitioner, and making false claims about the appropriateness of discussions;\r\nc. Setting financial barriers to prevent Petitioner from exercising his parenting time;\r\nd. Submitting edited video evidence and committing perjury to mislead the Court.\r\nRespondent�s actions are causing immediate and irreparable harm to Felix�s emotional well-being and his relationship with Petitioner. This behavior is intentional, malicious, and in direct violation of this Court�s orders and the best interests of the child.\r\nDespite Petitioner�s repeated attempts to address these issues, the Court has failed to take meaningful action, allowing Respondent to continue her harmful behavior unchecked.\r\nThis matter constitutes an emergency as it involves the immediate welfare of a child and the ongoing violation of Petitioner�s parental rights.\r\n\r\nII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nGrant an Emergency Hearing to address this matter immediately due to the urgent nature of the harm being caused to Felix and Petitioner�s relationship.\r\nOrder Respondent to Cease All Interference with Petitioner�s court-ordered parenting time and communication with Felix, including:\r\na.

    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for an order:\r\nCompelling Respondent, Crycella Freitag, to testify under oath regarding her claims of fear and her conduct in this matter;\r\nHolding Respondent in contempt for willful misrepresentation, perjury, and parental interference; and\r\nGranting remedial relief to restore Petitioner�s parental rights and address the harm caused by Respondent�s actions.\r\nIn support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n\r\nI. INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent�s Claims of Fear Are Fabricated and Contradict Her Own Testimony\r\nRespondent has repeatedly claimed she is �scared� of Petitioner to justify withholding the minor child, Felix, from him. However, in court proceedings, Respondent has never testified under oath that she is afraid of Petitioner or that he has done anything to warrant such fear.\r\nThis inconsistency demonstrates that Respondent�s claims are a deliberate fabrication designed to manipulate the Court and alienate Petitioner from his child.\r\nRespondent�s Collusion with Third Parties to Fabricate an Unstable Living Situation\r\nOn December 4, 2024, Respondent conspired with Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove to fabricate an �unstable living situation� for Petitioner.\r\nJozef Hanratty, Petitioner�s former landlord, rescinded his position and directed Petitioner to Kelly Truelove, who then refused all communication.\r\nRespondent facilitated this collusion by refusing to intervene, despite being fully aware of the circumstances.\r\nThis fabricated instability was used to secure a temporary custody order on January 28, 2025, which Respondent now leverages to deny Petitioner access to Felix.\r\nRespondent�s False Accusations and Edited Video Evidence\r\nRespondent originally submitted an edited 12 minute video to the Court, which she admitted was incomplete. The full video, which is over 40 minutes long, was intentionally reduced to then 30 minutes to remove exculpatory evidence and given to Micheal.\r\nIn the video, Petitioner explicitly states, �I see you recording, so let�s get this out of the way so we can have a relationship with our son.� He then lists hypothetical statements a �bad father� might make, which Respondent has since misrepresented as threats.\r\nRespondent�s manipulation of evidence constitutes perjury and a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court.\r\n\r\nII. RESPONDENT�S PATTERN OF MISCONDUCT\r\nRespondent�s Lies Under Oath\r\nRespondent has repeatedly lied under oath, including:\r\nClaiming Petitioner �kicked her out� of the house, despite testifying in court that she left voluntarily each week.\r\nFailing to disclose her collusion with Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove to fabricate Petitioner�s living situation.\r\nMisrepresenting the contents of the video evidence submitted to the Court.\r\nClaiming Petitioner�s housing is unstable, while being the culprit.\r\nRespondent�s Willful Parental Interference\r\nRespondent has consistently interfered with Petitioner�s relationship with Felix by:\r\nDenying Petitioner access to the child without justification.\r\nRefusing to comply with court-ordered visitation schedules.\r\nManipulating the child�s perception of Petitioner through false narratives.\r\nYelling, talking, and demonstrating unstable co-parenting skills in front of Felix during Petitioner's court appointed time forcing narrative.\r\n\r\nIII. REQUEST FOR RELIEF\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nCompel Respondent to Testify Under Oath\r\nRequire Respondent to testify regarding her claims of fear, her collusion with third parties, and her manipulation of evidence.\r\nHold Respondent in Contempt\r\nFind Respondent in contempt for:\r\nPerjury and willful misrepresentation to the Court.\r\nParental interference and violation of Petitioner�s custodial rights.\r\nManipulation of evidence to mislead the Court.\r\nGrant Remedial Relief\r\nInvalidate the temporary custody order obtained through fraudulent means.\r\nStrike everything Crycella submitted from record.\r\nOrder supervised visitation to restore Petitioner�s relationship with Felix.\r\nRequire Crycella to undergo a psychological evaluation to assess her fitness as a custodial parent.\r\nHave Crycella return all Micheal�s property - (PC)\r\nAward Petitioner attorney�s fees and costs incurred due to Respondent�s misconduct of no less than $60,000 for all the work attributed in the courts bias.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Pro Se, and moves this Court to review and compel the Stone County Circuit Clerk�s office to comply with its obligations under the Local Court Rules and the Missouri Sunshine Law. The Clerk�s refusal to schedule my emergency motion on the designated Motion Day and its misrepresentation of the hearing date constitute misconduct and obstruct my right to due process and timely relief.\r\n\r\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nEmergency Motion Filed on March 13, 2025:\r\nOn March 13, 2025, I filed an Emergency Motion to Enforce and Protect Parental Communication Rights (hereinafter �Emergency Motion�). This motion was filed in good faith to address urgent issues affecting my parental rights and the well-being of my child.\r\nProper Motion Day for Associate Division I:\r\nPursuant to Local Rule 2.3.2, Motion Days for Associate Division I (presided over by the Hon. Matt A. Selby) occur on the second Friday of each month. For March 2025, the designated Motion Day was March 14, 2025.\r\nClerk�s Refusal to Schedule Motion on March 14, 2025:\r\nDespite filing my Emergency Motion one day before the designated Motion Day (March 13, 2025), the Clerk�s office refused to schedule the motion for March 14, 2025. When I called the Clerk�s office on March 14, 2025, I was informed that my motion was not scheduled for that day and was instead set for April 7, 2025.\r\nMisrepresentation of Hearing Date:\r\nThe Clerk�s office provided no explanation for why my Emergency Motion was not scheduled on the proper Motion Day. Instead, they misrepresented the hearing date, claiming it was set for April 7, 2025, which is not a designated Motion Day for Associate Division I.\r\nViolation of Local Rules and Due Process:\r\nThe Clerk�s actions violate Local Rule 2.3.2 and obstruct my right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. By delaying the hearing of my Emergency Motion, the Clerk�s office is causing irreparable harm to my parental rights and my child�s well-being.\r\n\r\nII. LEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nClerk�s Failure to Follow Local Rules:\r\nThe Clerk�s refusal to schedule my Emergency Motion on the designated Motion Day (March 14, 2025) violates Local Rule 2.3.2, which explicitly states that Motion Days for Associate Division I occur on the second Friday of each month.\r\nMisrepresentation of Hearing Date:\r\nThe Clerk�s office misrepresented the hearing date by claiming my motion was set for April 7, 2025, which is not a valid Motion Day for Associate Division I. This creates the appearance of bias and deliberate obstruction.\r\nViolation of Due Process:\r\nThe Clerk�s actions obstruct my right to due process by delaying the hearing of my Emergency Motion. Emergency motions are intended to address urgent matters, and any delay undermines their purpose and causes irreparable harm.\r\nFailure to Provide Public Records:\r\nDespite my formal requests under the Missouri Sunshine Law (RSMo � 610.010, et seq.), the Clerk�s office has refused to provide a list of scheduled motion hearings and other public records. This lack of transparency further obstructs my ability to advocate for my rights.\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, I respectfully request that this Court:\r\nOrder the Clerk�s Office to immediately provide a list of all motion hearings scheduled from March 1, 2025, to April 7, 2025, including the case numbers, parties involved, and hearing types.\r\nCompel the Clerk�s Office to provide a written explanation as to why my Emergency Motion was not scheduled on the designated Motion Day (March 14, 2025) and why it was instead set for April 7, 2025.\r\nReview the Clerk�s scheduling actions for potential misconduct, including violations of Local Court Rules and the Missouri Sunshine Law.\r\nSet my Emergency Motion for the earliest valid Motion Day in accordance with Local Rule 2.3.2.\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.`

In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nThe Layne Project has engaged in communications and financial arrangements directly impacting the outcome of court-ordered visitation.\r\nOn 02/19/2025, Emily of the Layne Project informed Petitioner via text message that if he could not pay for supervised visitation, they would seek payment from Respondent, and if she refused, they would notify the Court. Despite these assurances, the Layne Project has failed to notify the Court while continuing discussions with Respondent.\r\nThe requested subpoena seeks the production of:\r\na. All communications (including but not limited to emails, text messages, letters, and notes) between the Layne Project, Micheal Salmon, Crycella Freitag, Joshua Garrett, Natalie Kluttz, Carolyn Salmon, Chanille Witham, and any court personnel regarding this case.\r\nb. All records of payments, invoices, or financial agreements related to this case, including any communications regarding payment disputes.\r\nc.

All records of communications between the Layne Project and the Court regarding this matter.\r\nAdditionally, Petitioner seeks to depose representatives of the Layne Project regarding their involvement in the facilitation or obstruction of visitation.\r\nThis information is crucial to determining the extent to which the Layne Project has intervened in the visitation process in a manner inconsistent with their stated obligations and the best interests of the minor child.\r\nPetitioner has reason to believe that Respondent and third parties may be using the Layne Project�s inaction to interfere with visitation rights.\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a subpoena compelling the Layne Project to produce the requested documents and to appear for deposition at a date and time to be determined by the Court.\r\nMOTION TO INCLUDE LAYNE PROJECT INTERVENTION IN CASE RECORD\r\nCOMES NOW, the Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to formally recognize the Layne Project's interference in this case and compel appropriate corrective action. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nThe Layne Project was assigned to facilitate supervised visitation and communication between the parties.\r\nPetitioner was informed by Emily, an employee of the Layne Project, via text message that due to financial constraints, the Layne Project would seek payment from the Respondent and, if she refused, they would notify the Court.\r\nPetitioner proactively informed the Layne Project to proceed accordingly and has remained transparent in all communications regarding the matter.\r\nThe owner of the Layne Project, Trina Nudson, who is also an attorney, confirmed this procedural step to Petitioner.\r\nDespite these assurances, the Layne Project has failed to contact the Court as promised and instead has continued to engage with Respondent, who insists on enforcing the payment requirement while knowing Petitioner cannot comply.\r\nThis inaction has directly affected Petitioner's ability to engage in court-ordered visitations, thereby interfering with due process and access to parental rights.\r\nSuch failure to act as stated constitutes a material obstruction of justice, warranting judicial intervention.\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nOrder the Layne Project to submit a written explanation of their actions and why they have not contacted the Court as stated.\r\nInclude the Layne Project�s conduct as a relevant factor in the proceedings.\r\nIssue any further relief deemed necessary and just under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence WebApp: https://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html`

    title: "Letter to Judge Selby",
    date: "2025-25-3",
    type: "Letter",
    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `Dear Judge Selby,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Court�s notice of hearing for March 26th, 2025 at 10:30 a.m - \r\nI am writing to formally address the ongoing violations of my rights and the court�s repeated failure to apply legal standards fairly in my custody case. This letter serves as an official request for written clarification on multiple legal errors and procedural violations that have obstructed my ability to seek justice. As established in State ex rel. Houska v. Dickhaner, 323 S.W.3d 29 (Mo. 2010), mandamus is appropriate when a court fails to perform duties required by law or abuses its discretion in ways that cannot be adequately remedied through ordinary appeals. The pattern of procedural violations in this case meets this standard.\r\n1. The Unlawful Basis for the Temporary Custody Order\r\nMissouri law is clear on the requirements for granting a temporary custody order: Imminent Danger Standard (RSMo 210.125): Emergency custody can only be granted if there is reasonable cause to believe a child is in immediate danger due to abuse or neglect. Temporary Custody Orders (RSMo 452.380): Courts must rely on clear, supporting evidence demonstrating that a change in custody is in the child�s best interest.\r\nThe sole justification for granting the temporary custody motion was the false testimony of Jozef Hanratty, who falsely claimed I was facing eviction. The court itself acknowledged that if I remained in my residence the following week, it would prove Jozef�s dishonesty.\r\nOne week later, I was still in my residence, confirming the perjury committed by Hanratty. Despite this, my motion to dismiss was ignored. Furthermore, I have since submitted multiple documents proving Jozef and Crycella�s dishonesty, including:\r\nA letter from Kelly Truelove�s attorney validating my lawful tenancy.\r\nVideo evidence of Crycella denying my court-ordered communication with Felix.\r\nFormal legal documents disproving the eviction claim.\r\nYet, the court has refused to review this clear and irrefutable evidence, allowing an unlawful ruling to stand in direct violation of due process. Mr. Garrett has facilitated this unlawful and in bad faith conspiracy to purge me of my residence.\r\nThe Missouri Supreme Court in In re Marriage of Hendrix, 183 S.W.3d 582 (Mo. 2006), established that modifications to custody must be supported by substantial evidence demonstrating that a change would serve the child's best interests. The court's continued reliance on Mr. Hanratty's demonstrably false testimony violates this standard. Furthermore, in Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d 30 (Mo. 1976), the court established that judicial decisions must be supported by substantial evidence and cannot be against the weight of the evidence. The refusal to consider my documentary proof directly contradicts this foundational principle of Missouri law.\r\n2. Due Process Violations and the Court�s Pattern of Dismissal\r\nFor nearly two months, I have submitted repeated requests for enforcement of court orders, sanctions for perjury, and responses to procedural violations. Instead of legal resolution, I have been met with deliberate inaction, refusal to acknowledge evidence, and arbitrary denials of my motions. The following concerns require immediate explanation:\r\nWhy has the court repeatedly refused to review my submitted evidence?\r\nWhy have I been denied an opportunity to properly present my case, with time limits imposed despite the complexity and volume of the evidence?\r\nWhy has the court failed to enforce its own orders when Crycella continues to violate custody agreements and deny communication?\r\nWhat standard of proof is this court applying, and why is it selectively disregarding evidence that disproves the opposing party�s claims?\r\nThe refusal to provide transparency on these legal issues does not just harm me�it sets a precedent that erodes public trust in the judicial system. The United States Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), recognized that parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children. This court's repeated refusal to review submitted evidence and provide a fair hearing violates this constitutionally protected right. As established in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), procedural due process requires balancing the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation through current procedures, and the government's interest. The current proceedings fail this constitutional test by systematically denying my opportunity to present evidence that directly refutes the claims upon which the temporary order was based.\r\n3. The Court�s Direct Role in Facilitating the Destruction of Parental Rights\r\nThe law recognizes that continued separation from a parent is inherently damaging to a child. If the court is genuinely operating in Felix�s best interest, it must answer the following:\r\nHow does prolonged separation from a fit and loving parent benefit Felix�s well-being?\r\nWhat specific needs was Felix not receiving while in my care?\r\nWhy has the court refused to provide a formal reason for my denied custody and visitation rights?\r\nYour refusal to address these questions has directly enabled the obstruction of my parental rights, and the damage inflicted upon my relationship with Felix may soon become irreparable. In Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972), the Supreme Court held that parents are entitled to a hearing on their fitness before their children can be removed from their custody. This court has effectively bypassed this requirement by maintaining separation without proper evidentiary basis. The Missouri Court of Appeals in Searcy v. Searcy, 38 S.W.3d 462 (Mo. App. 2001), emphasized that the best interest of the child standard requires consideration of the child's need for meaningful contact with both parents. The prolonged and unjustified separation from Felix directly contradicts this established legal principle.\r\n4. Judicial Negligence Has Resulted in a Legal Imbalance\r\nYour Honor, in a courtroom, both parties must be held to the same standard. Yet, Mr. Garrett and Crycella have been permitted to:\r\nCommit perjury without consequence.\r\nIgnore court orders without penalty.\r\nRefuse transparency while I am forced to provide full financial disclosure.\r\nWithhold communications and legal documentation necessary for my case.\r\nMeanwhile, I have faced relentless obstruction in my efforts to simply ensure fairness.\r\n5. The Court�s Failure to Address These Issues Will Be Part of the Official Record\r\nAs established in Nazeri v. Missouri Valley College, 860 S.W.2d 303 (Mo. 1993), courts have an obligation to consider evidence properly submitted. The systematic dismissal of my evidence without explanation violates this fundamental judicial responsibility. For the purposes of creating a clear record for appeal under the standards set forth in Murphy v. Carron, I request specific findings regarding what evidence the court has considered and the legal basis for dismissing verified documentation that directly contradicts opposing counsel's claims.\r\nTo ensure clarity and for the purposes of an appeal, I request that the following be addressed:\r\nWhat specific evidence does this court consider insufficient, and by what legal standard is it being dismissed?\r\nHas the court reviewed the video evidence of Crycella violating my custody rights?\r\nWhat authority does Mr. Garrett have in determining custody arrangements, and why has he been given the authority to refuse communication between me and my son?\r\nWhy has the court failed to enforce its own orders while simultaneously penalizing me for procedural actions that I have lawfully followed?\r\nWhat additional evidence does the court require to correct its clear bias?\r\n6. This Court Must Take Responsibility for the Harm It Has Caused\r\nThe failure to fairly enforce the law has emboldened Crycella to continue violating my rights without fear of consequence. This is not just a failure of one case�it is an institutional failure that undermines the very function of the judicial system. This court�s failure to enforce the law fairly has created an environment where Crycella feels emboldened to violate my rights with impunity, effectively destroying any chance at a meaningful parent-child relationship. Your Honor, awarding fees to Crycella and Mr. Garrett in this case would set a dangerous precedent�one where pro se litigants who uncover procedural errors are penalized financially while attorneys who fail to address these errors get rewarded. The work I have done vastly exceeds Mr. Garrett�s, and it was necessitated by his and the court�s own failures. \r\nI demand a formal, on-the-record response to these issues before my upcoming hearing and request that this letter be entered into the official record of these proceedings.`

The actions of Judge Matt Alan Selby demonstrate a willful and persistent failure to perform duties, a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and conduct that brings the judiciary into disrepute.\r\nCase No. 24SN-DR00104\r\nAllegations of Judicial Misconduct:\r\nWillful Failure to Perform Duties & Due Process Violations\r\nJudge Matt Alan Selby has systematically ignored and refused to rule on numerous motions that were properly filed and served.\r\nThis refusal to address critical legal matters has directly prejudiced my case and deprived me of my constitutional right to a fair hearing.\r\nBias and Unequal Treatment of Litigants\r\nThe judge has demonstrated a pattern of favoring the opposing party, including responding to their informal communications while refusing to address my formal filings.\r\nIn one instance, the judge ignored my submitted physical evidence, refused to accept it, then ruled in the opposing counsel's favor because he had to pick his kids up from school.\r\nFailure to Adhere to Court Procedures & Judicial Ethics\r\nThe judge has acted in contravention of judicial standards by failing to issue written orders on key matters, making it impossible to properly appeal rulings.\r\nThe judge has permitted opposing counsel to violate procedural rules without consequence while holding me, as a pro se litigant, to a different standard.\r\nConduct Bringing the Judiciary into Disrepute\r\nThe judge�s refusal to rule on properly submitted filings, coupled with apparent bias, has created the appearance of impropriety and diminished public confidence in the court�s ability to function impartially.\r\nRequested Action:\r\nGiven the severity of these violations, I respectfully request the Commission conduct a full investigation intoJudge Matt Alan Selby�s misconduct. I urge the Commission to consider formal disciplinary action, including reprimand, suspension, or referral to the Missouri Supreme Court for removal, if appropriate.\r\nI have attached supporting documents, including copies of my motions, court transcripts, and any relevant communications, to substantiate my claims. I am available to provide further information or testimony as needed.\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.`

In support thereof, Movant states as follows:\r\n1. Judicial Misconduct and Bias\r\nThe Court repeatedly misrepresented Movant�s statements on record, requiring Movant to repeat himself multiple times while the judge feigned confusion.\r\nThe Court�s behavior resulted in material distortion of the record, which may severely impact appellate review and deprives Movant of a fair hearing.\r\nThe Court manipulated the proceedings to align with a predetermined outcome, ignoring relevant facts and legal arguments presented by Movant.\r\nThe court refused three occasions of preliminary questions that would assist Movant.\r\n2. Denial of Due Process\r\nThe Webex hearing was improperly terminated, preventing Movant from asking critical questions and further clarifying mischaracterized statements.\r\nThe Court disregarded prior motions and filings, forcing Movant to resubmit information that had already been placed on record, thereby delaying resolution and causing undue burden.\r\nThe Court allowed opposing counsel, Josh Garrett, to unilaterally dictate supervision terms without review or proper legal authority.\r\n3. Failure to Enforce Custody and Visitation Rights\r\nMovant has been wrongfully denied visitation with his child, Felix, for over two months, in direct violation of prior orders and Missouri custody laws.\r\nThe Court failed to take action despite acknowledging that Respondent, Crycella Freitag, was in violation of previous orders.\r\nThe Court�s inaction effectively condones Respondent�s noncompliance, further alienating Movant from his child and undermining the best interests of the minor.\r\n4. Misconduct by Opposing Counsel\r\nOpposing counsel, Josh Garrett, falsely framed a prior phone call to paint Movant in a negative light, attempting to distort the record.\r\nThe Court, while acknowledging a \"grey area,\" nonetheless failed to hold Respondent accountable for her refusal to comply with court-ordered visitation.\r\nOpposing counsel has continuously acted in bad faith by obstructing Movant�s parental rights, yet the Court continues to allow his undue influence over supervision arrangements.\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nCorrect the official court record to reflect Movant�s actual statements, as opposed to the judge�s mischaracterizations.\r\nProvide Movant with an opportunity to clarify any outstanding issues unfairly cut off during the Webex hearing.\r\nImmediately enforce prior visitation orders and sanction Respondent for willful noncompliance.\r\nRemove opposing counsel�s undue influence over supervision arrangements and assign an impartial third party.\r\nIssue any further relief deemed just and proper in the interest of fairness and due process.\r\nPETITIONER�S MOTION FOR HEARING AND REVIEW\r\nCOMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court set a hearing and conduct a review on March 31, 2025, to address the numerous accusations and questions that the Court has refused to acknowledge throughout these proceedings. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nPetitioner has submitted multiple motions highlighting critical procedural failures, judicial bias concerns, and violations of due process that have yet to be properly acknowledged or adjudicated.\r\nThe Court has failed to respond to or act upon key motions and court orders, creating an unfair and prejudicial environment against Petitioner.\r\nThe Court has provided responses to the opposing counsel�s submissions while refusing to address direct communications and concerns raised by Petitioner, further demonstrating bias and procedural misconduct.\r\nPetitioner asserts that the failure to address these issues has resulted in continued harm and an obstruction of justice, warranting immediate review and resolution.\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nA. Schedule a hearing on March 31, 2025, to review all unacknowledged accusations and procedural concerns raised by Petitioner; B.

Nevertheless, the March 26 Notice of Entry falsely states that Movant was ordered to obtain the evaluation, thus inaccurately portraying Movant as noncompliant.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial Fraud on the Record.\r\n\r\n The March 26 Notice claims:\r\n \"Movant was ordered to obtain a psychological examination on February 25, 2025.\"\r\n This statement is demonstrably false. As the attached order (Exhibit A) clearly indicates, the responsibility to arrange and pay for the evaluation was placed on Counter-Respondent Freitag, not Movant. This misrepresentation has prejudiced Movant by casting a false light on his compliance with court orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelegation of Judicial Responsibilities to Opposing Counsel.\r\n\r\n In a recent phone call with the Clerk�s Office (Exhibit C), the Clerk confirmed:\r\n \"The judge said you need to contact Mr. Garrett for next steps.\"\r\n This is a violation of Missouri Code of Judicial Conduct 2.2, which prohibits judges from delegating their judicial responsibilities to opposing counsel. Mr. Garrett has no legal authority to dictate the Court�s orders. This conduct undermines the integrity of these proceedings and violates Movant�s rights to a fair and impartial process.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nMovant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nOrder Counter-Respondent Freitag to schedule and pay for the psychological evaluation within 48 hours of this motion�s filing or hold Counter-Respondent Freitag in contempt of court for failing to comply with the February 25, 2025 order.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrike the false statement in the March 26 Notice of Entry which claims that Movant was ordered to obtain the psychological evaluation, correcting the record to reflect the true terms of the February 25 order.\r\n\r\n\r\nSanction Counter-Respondent Freitag and Attorney Garrett for their continued noncompliance and misrepresentation of the Court�s orders, as outlined above.\r\n\r\n\r\nClarify that the judge�not opposing counsel�must rule on motions and make determinations regarding procedural matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOF OF FRAUD (FILED EXHIBITS)\r\nExhibit A: February 25, 2025 Order, showing Counter-Respondent Freitag�s obligation to arrange and pay for the evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExhibit B: March 26, 2025 Notice of Entry, highlighting the fraudulent statement regarding the responsibility for the psychological evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExhibit C: Call log/recording from Clerk�s Office, confirming the judge�s improper delegation of responsibilities to opposing counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL WARNING TO THE COURT\r\nAs the Missouri Court of Appeals is currently reviewing this case:\r\nCourt of Appeals Case No. SD38905\r\nMovant formally requests the Court take immediate action to correct these issues. If the Court fails to address these concerns promptly:\r\nMovant will file a judicial misconduct complaint against the judge and counsel involved in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovant will seek federal intervention under 42 U.S.C. � 1983 for violations of constitutional rights, including due process and equal protection.`

    title: "MOTION FOR SOLE CUSTODY, CHILD SUPPORT, AND LEGAL FEES",
    date: "2025-27-3",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court for an immediate ruling on all pending motions, an award of sole legal and physical custody, child support, and legal fees, based on the following:\r\nI. MOTION FOR PROMPT RULING ON PENDING MOTIONS\r\nMovant has filed multiple motions essential to the fair adjudication of this case, yet they remain unresolved despite proper service and presentation to the Court.\r\nThe lack of rulings has caused significant prejudice to Movant, including but not limited to:\r\nHindrance of Movant�s ability to exercise court-ordered parenting time.\r\nProcedural confusion due to the Court�s failure to enforce compliance.\r\nLack of legal clarity, creating an unfair advantage for Respondent.\r\nFailure to rule on these motions constitutes judicial inaction, violating Movant�s due process rights and judicial efficiency principles.\r\nMovant requests an immediate ruling on all pending motions, including a written explanation for any motion the Court declines to rule on.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nIssue rulings on all outstanding motions without further delay;\r\nProvide a written explanation for any motion the Court declines to rule on; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\nII. MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE AWARD OF MAKEUP PARENTING TIME DUE TO COURT-CAUSED PREJUDICE\r\nOn 03/26/2025, this Court issued a correction acknowledging prior procedural errors that contributed to delays in Movant�s parenting time.\r\nThese delays were not caused by Movant but rather by court-recognized procedural failures and Respondent�s noncompliance.\r\nAs a direct result, Movant has suffered a significant and unjust loss of time with his child, which has harmed the parent-child relationship.\r\nThe Court has both the authority and the obligation to rectify this harm by awarding immediate and uninterrupted makeup parenting time.\r\nMovant requests that the full amount of lost time be restored in an expedited manner.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nOrder immediate makeup parenting time for the full amount of time lost due to court delays;\r\nSet an expedited schedule for the makeup time; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and necessary.\r\nIII. MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST RESPONDENT FOR MISREPRESENTATION AND NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS\r\nThe Court�s recent correction confirms that Respondent engaged in misrepresentation regarding the execution of prior orders.\r\nRespondent�s deliberate mischaracterization of the Court�s directive resulted in an unjustified loss of Movant�s parenting time.\r\nThe Court has the inherent authority to sanction parties who act in bad faith and obstruct justice.\r\nMovant requests that this Court impose appropriate sanctions, including but not limited to:\r\nMonetary sanctions for attorney�s fees and costs incurred due to Respondent�s misrepresentation.\r\nCompensatory sanctions in the form of additional parenting time beyond standard makeup time.\r\nJudicial warnings or contempt findings to deter further misconduct.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nIssue sanctions against Respondent for bad faith conduct;\r\nAward compensatory relief in the form of additional parenting time; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\nIV. MOTION FOR SOLE CUSTODY, CHILD SUPPORT, AND LEGAL FEES\r\nGiven the documented history of Respondent�s noncompliance, obstruction, and misrepresentation, it is in the best interest of the minor child that Movant be awarded sole legal and physical custody.\r\nRespondent has demonstrated a pattern of behavior that prioritizes obstruction over the well-being of the child, necessitating a change in custody.\r\nMovant has provided a stable and supportive environment, and granting sole custody will ensure the child�s best interests are met.\r\nMovant requests that Respondent be ordered to pay child support in accordance with statutory guidelines, retroactive to the date of initial filing.\r\nGiven Respondent�s bad faith conduct, Movant also seeks an award of legal fees incurred due to unnecessary litigation caused by Respondent�s actions.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nAward Movant sole legal and physical custody of the minor child;\r\nOrder Respondent to pay child support, retroactive to 1 year;\r\nAward Movant all previous motions in full;\r\nOrder Respondent to pay Movant�s legal fees; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.`

    date: "2025-27-3",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Granted",
    content: `NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully submits into evidence the official court dismissal of the eviction action filed against him by Kelly Truelove, which directly undermines the opposing party�s claims regarding his living situation and exposes a pattern of conspiracy and bad faith litigation. In support of this motion, Movant states as follows:\r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe basis for Counter-Respondent�s claims against Movant has been the false assertion that Movant�s living situation was unstable, a claim purportedly supported by an eviction proceeding initiated by Kelly Truelove.\r\nOn 03/21/2025, the eviction case filed by Kelly Truelove was officially dismissed.\r\nThis dismissal, occurring without an adjudication on the merits, demonstrates that the eviction claim itself was either legally unfounded or strategically abandoned, undermining any assertion that Movant�s residence was unstable or unsuitable for parenting time.\r\nEVIDENCE OF COLLUSION AND BAD FAITH\r\nCounter-Respondent, through her attorney Josh Garrett, has relied on the purported eviction to bolster her case against Movant, despite lacking any valid legal foundation.\r\nAttorney Josh Garrett has admitted to direct communication with Kelly Truelove regarding Movant�s residence, indicating a coordinated effort to fabricate instability in order to justify denying Movant custody rights.\r\nThe involvement of multiple parties in propagating this false narrative constitutes a deliberate conspiracy to prejudice Movant�s case through fraudulent claims and misuse of legal procedures.\r\nThis Court has a duty to recognize and act upon evidence of bad faith litigation tactics, particularly where such actions have materially impacted Movant�s parental rights and due process protections.\r\nLEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nThe submission of evidence demonstrating fraud upon the court and coordinated deception is both relevant and necessary for the just resolution of this case.\r\nCourts have an inherent authority to sanction parties who engage in bad faith litigation and to ensure that judgments are rendered based on factual and legal integrity rather than manufactured falsehoods.\r\nThe dismissal of the eviction action negates the sole argument advanced by Counter-Respondent regarding Movant�s alleged instability and further justifies the granting of full custody to Movant.\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nAccept the official dismissal of the eviction case as submitted evidence in the appeal and present case;\r\nRecognize the coordinated effort to misrepresent Movant�s living situation and consider such actions in the Court�s final determinations;\r\nIssue any necessary sanctions or corrective actions to address the bad faith conduct of Counter-Respondent and her counsel;\r\nGrant any other relief this Court deems just and proper.`

    content: `Dear Judge Selby,\r\nI am submitting the official dismissal of the eviction case filed against me as evidence in my ongoing custody proceedings. This dismissal directly refutes the fabricated claims regarding my living situation�claims that have been used to justify the denial of my parental rights.\r\nThis Court has repeatedly delayed ruling on critical motions, allowing opposing counsel to advance demonstrably false narratives without consequence. The evidence now before you exposes coordinated misconduct between Counter-Respondent and her attorney, Josh Garrett, who actively conspired with the landlord to present a fraudulent basis for my alleged instability.\r\nGiven the gravity of this misconduct and its direct impact on my case, I request immediate acknowledgment of this evidence, proper rulings on all outstanding motions, and corrective action against those who have manipulated this Court�s proceedings. Any failure to act would constitute a knowing disregard for due process and the integrity of these proceedings.\r\nI demand a formal, on-the-record response to these issues before my upcoming hearing and request that this letter be entered into the official record of these proceedings.`

    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `Judge Matt Alan Selby,\r\nThis letter serves as formal notice of this Court�s continued failure to adhere to due process, enforce its own orders, and rule in accordance with the law. The record reflects that I, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, have been subjected to systematic judicial bias, manipulated narratives, and unjust rulings, despite overwhelming evidence in my favor.\r\nThis Court has engaged in a repeated pattern of the following misconduct:\r\nManipulating the Narrative in Hearings:\r\nThe Court dismissed clear and material evidence while allowing misrepresentations to stand uncontested, despite my corrections on the record.\r\nThe Court mischaracterized my legal arguments to justify an adverse ruling that contradicts both statutory law and precedent.\r\nRuling Against Me with Bias:\r\nOn multiple occasions, this Court has denied motions based not on their merit, but rather on procedural maneuvers that favor the opposing party.\r\nThe Court has refused to recognize and correct prior rulings that were based on false statements, even after those statements were disproven with objective evidence.\r\nIgnoring Hard Evidence:\r\nThe Court has systematically disregarded documentary, testimonial, and procedural evidence that would otherwise mandate rulings in my favor.\r\nExample: The Court upheld an order despite clear fraud in its foundation, ignoring my filed motions documenting the fraudulent nature of the evidence relied upon.\r\nPenalizing Me for Correcting the Court�s Errors:\r\nThe record reflects instances where I have been penalized, not for any legal misconduct, but for pointing out the Court�s failure to properly consider the facts and law in this case.\r\nInstead of correcting the record, the Court has resorted to procedural deflections and further delaying tactics.\r\nMOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT DUE TO JUDICIAL NONCOMPLIANCE & FAILURE TO RULE\r\nCOMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court for an immediate default ruling in his favor due to the Court�s ongoing failure to adjudicate filed motions, enforce its own orders, and uphold due process. In support of this motion, Movant states as follows:\r\nThis Court has repeatedly failed to rule on numerous pending motions despite clear violations of law and due process.\r\nThe Respondent, Crycella Freitag, has now violated the Court�s own order from March 26, 2025, by refusing to allow uninterrupted scheduled phone calls and interfering with Movant�s communication with his son, intentionally, repetitively, and under direction to stop.\r\nThis marks the fourth time that Crycella has directly ignored a standing Court order without consequence, demonstrating a pattern of willful defiance.\r\nThe Court�s refusal to enforce its own orders, while simultaneously allowing Respondent to benefit from unlawful rulings, has resulted in an unfair and prejudicial legal process against Movant.\r\nBy failing to rule on critical motions and ignoring clear judicial misconduct, the Court is in direct violation of Movant�s constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.\r\nThe failure to rule has caused substantial harm to Movant, who remains deprived of his parental rights and subjected to judicial bias with no recourse.`

    content: `COMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this formal Notice of Judicial Noncompliance and Obstruction of Due Process, as this Court has engaged in an ongoing and deliberate pattern of failing to act in accordance with the law.\r\nThis Court has refused to rule on multiple critical motions that directly impact the fundamental rights of Movant and his child.\r\nThis Court has knowingly upheld fraudulent orders, despite having full awareness of their unlawful nature.\r\nThis Court has allowed Respondent, Crycella Freitag, to violate four separate court orders with complete impunity, including her most recent violation on March 26, 2025, when she unlawfully prevented Movant�s court-ordered phone calls with his son.\r\nThe judge presiding over this matter has intentionally delayed proceedings despite having open hearing dates available sooner, demonstrating an intentional strategy to obstruct justice.\r\nThis Court�s inaction serves no legal purpose except to harm Movant and further enable Respondent�s continued violations of the law.\r\nBy failing to rule on these matters, the Court is now engaging in judicial obstruction, violating Movant�s right to due process under both state and federal law.\r\nMovant has exhausted all proper channels for relief, including filing a Writ of Mandamus, Motion to Disqualify, Motion for Judicial Notice of Fraud, and Request for Immediate Hearing�all of which this Court has deliberately ignored.\r\nAs such, Movant hereby places this Court on official notice that this continued refusal to act will be documented for appellate review, judicial oversight committees, and potential federal litigation under 42 U.S.C. � 1983 for due process violations.\r\nDEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION\r\nI am not requesting a hearing, as the law is clear.

“It is a fundamental principle of law that ignorance of procedural duties does not excuse a public officer from the consequences of violating a citizen’s rights.”
 — Owens v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 649 (1980)
“Where a party is under a duty to preserve evidence… the destruction or suppression of such evidence gives rise to a presumption that the evidence would have been unfavorable.”
 — Silvestri v. General Motors Corp., 271 F.3d 583, 593 (4th Cir. 2001)
“Government officials are charged with knowing the law and are not permitted to avoid liability by feigning ignorance of constitutional requirements.”
 — Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)
“Systematic noncompliance with established law by administrative actors justifies immediate judicial intervention and presumptive inference of intentional obstruction.”

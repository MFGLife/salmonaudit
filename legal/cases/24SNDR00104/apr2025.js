    content: `Comes now Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and states the following in response to Petitioner�s objections:\r\nSupervised visitation is unnecessary. The requirement was based on an unfair custody order that was issued on false premises. The underlying claims were dismissed without prejudice, and the order was imposed outside the proper jurisdiction.\r\nRespondent�s objections are contradictory. Respondent claims none of the proposed providers offer supervision, yet admits at least two do but dismisses them due to distance. This contradicts the argument that no viable options exist and demonstrates obstruction rather than cooperation.\r\nRespondent has continuously acted in bad faith to prevent my time with Felix. It has now been two months since I have been allowed to see my son, despite no valid legal justification for continued interference.\r\nWherefore, Respondent requests the Court immediately reinstate my parenting time and grant any further relief deemed just and proper.`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `I, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, as the Movant in the above-referenced case, formally submit this request for judicial review and immediate forwarding of this matter to the appellate court due to procedural irregularities and judicial obstruction that have severely impacted my ability to receive a fair and impartial hearing. In support of this request, I state the following:\r\nUnaddressed Critical Evidence\r\nThe only remaining evidence being used against me is an edited video that has yet to be ruled on by this Court. The refusal to make a determination on this evidence directly impacts the integrity of this case and my ability to properly defend myself.\r\nIgnored Emergency Motion for Charges\r\nI filed an Emergency Motion for Charges, and various Subpoenas requesting phone records to expose illegal conversations between Kelly Truelove, Jozef Hanratty, Josh Garrett, and Crycella Freitag. This motion remains ignored, despite its clear relevance in establishing collusion and perjury within these proceedings.\r\nJudicial Obstruction and Procedural Violations\r\nThe Court has consistently ignored my motions while granting those of the opposing party, allowing unchecked perjury, and failing to rule on critical evidence that would dismantle the basis for the custody determination.\r\nThe custody order itself is founded on documented collusion, conspiracy, and perjury�facts which this Court has been presented with repeatedly but refuses to address.\r\nAdditionally, the Court�s persistent refusal to allow me to properly present my case, prepare my arguments, and engage in meaningful hearings constitutes a severe violation of due process.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY MOTION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF PARENTING TIME, CONTEMPT, AND IMMEDIATE RELIEF\r\n1. Background\r\n1.1. This Court previously entered an order granting Movant specific parenting time, including scheduled in-person visits and video calls at designated times and locations.\r\n1.2. Despite these explicit orders, Respondent has repeatedly and willfully violated the Court�s directive by denying Movant his rightful parenting time.\r\n1.3. Most recently, Respondent again denied Movant his court-ordered parenting time this weekend, despite clear instructions from this Court.\r\n2. Ongoing Emotional and Psychological Abuse of the Minor Child\r\n2.1. During a recent video call, the minor child, Felix, exhibited extreme emotional distress, crying uncontrollably for the entire duration of the call.\r\n2.2. Respondent has systematically taught the minor child to hang up on Movant over the past months, thereby actively facilitating alienation and destruction of the parent-child bond.\r\n2.3. When the child was no longer able to disconnect the call, he became severely distressed, at which point Respondent physically struck the child multiple times in an attempt to force compliance.\r\n2.4. Rather than comforting the child, Respondent escalated the situation, verbally reinforcing his distress and punishing him for expressing emotions.\r\n2.5. This behavior demonstrates a deliberate effort to emotionally manipulate and alienate the minor child, causing severe psychological harm.\r\n3. Contempt of Court and Request for Immediate Enforcement\r\n3.1. Respondent�s repeated and blatant disregard for this Court�s orders constitutes willful contempt and justifies immediate court intervention.\r\n3.2. The alienation, physical discipline, and emotional manipulation of the minor child must cease immediately, as these actions are abusive and cause irreparable harm to his well-being.\r\n4. Emergency Relief Requested\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Court to:\r\nFind Respondent in contempt of court for her repeated violations of court orders regarding parenting time and video calls;\r\nGrant an immediate hearing to address these violations and impose appropriate sanctions on Respondent;\r\nOrder make-up parenting time for all missed sessions and ensure strict enforcement moving forward;\r\nSuspend all video calls until such time that Respondent demonstrates a good faith effort to facilitate them without interference or emotional manipulation of the minor child;\r\nModify the current order to provide for immediate enforcement mechanisms to prevent further interference with parenting time, including law enforcement involvement if necessary;\r\nIssue any other relief this Court deems just and necessary in the best interest of the minor child.\r\nWherefore, Respondent requests the Court immediately reinstate my custody and grant any further relief deemed just and proper.`

    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, proceeding pro se, and respectfully petitions this Court to issue a Writ of Prohibition preventing the Honorable Matt Alan Selby from exercising further jurisdiction over the underlying custody matter due to judicial bias, obstruction of justice, and persistent violations of due process. In support, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n1. Jurisdiction and Legal Basis\r\n1.1. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Prohibition under Article V, Section 4 of the Missouri Constitution and Missouri Rule 84.22 et seq., which allows for prohibition to prevent a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or engaging in conduct that denies fundamental fairness.\r\n1.2. A Writ of Prohibition is appropriate where a judge has exhibited bias, refused to rule on critical motions, obstructed justice, or failed to uphold legal procedures in a manner that irreparably harms the litigant�s rights.\r\n1.3. Missouri case law supports the issuance of a Writ of Prohibition where a lower court acts in excess of its jurisdiction or engages in judicial misconduct (State ex rel. Riverside Joint Venture v. Missouri Gaming Comm�n, 969 S.W.2d 218, 222 (Mo. banc 1998)).\r\n1.4.

    type: "Notice",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `I am addressing the ongoing failure of this Court to enforce its own order regarding my psychological evaluation and the selective application of requirements that continue to benefit the Respondent.\r\nI, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, was ordered to complete a psychological evaluation. When I was directed toward a racially biased white psychologist, I motioned for an alternative and provided two Black psychologists. The Court granted my motion, yet Respondent has failed to schedule the required evaluation. Despite this, I complied to the best of my ability by undergoing evaluations through two AI psychologists. The Court has failed to enforce its own ruling while allowing Respondent to evade compliance entirely.\r\nAdditionally, I requested a psychological evaluation for Respondent to ensure fairness, yet the Court has ignored this motion, continuing the pattern of bias. If the Court will not enforce this order against Respondent, she should be barred from making psychological claims or defenses at trial.\r\nInstead of ruling on my motion to enforce compliance, the Court has chosen to delay all decisions by scheduling a last-minute hearing on April 4, 2025, lumping together all pending motions. However, this hearing has now been abruptly canceled without reason, further delaying justice and denying me my right to have these urgent matters addressed. The Court�s refusal to issue rulings while obstructing my ability to be heard is a clear procedural failure that only benefits Respondent at my expense.\r\nRather than addressing these issues, the Court appears focused on venue changes rather than issuing rulings. I request an immediate ruling enforcing Respondent�s compliance with the psychological evaluation order and sanctions for her failure to act. If the Court fails to enforce its order, Respondent must be barred from introducing psychological arguments in trial. The Court�s continued delay, along with the unjustified cancellation of scheduled proceedings, only compounds the procedural failures that have already prejudiced my case.\r\nJUDICIAL NOTICE OF COURT FAILURE TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION ORDER\r\nCOMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this Judicial Notice regarding the Court�s failure to enforce its own orders pertaining to psychological evaluations, stating as follows:\r\nPursuant to prior court orders, both parties were required to complete psychological evaluations.\r\nMovant has fully complied, completing and submitting two AI-based psychological evaluations in February 2025.\r\nRespondent was directed to schedule a psychological evaluation and was provided two Black psychologists for scheduling on March 18 2025 prior to this filing.\r\n\r\nVerified Qualified Evaluators � Respondent now submits two verified professionals with the credentials and experience necessary for psychological evaluations relevant to this case:\r\n\r\n\r\nCaleb M. Stephens, LMSW, LCSW � A licensed therapist based in Kansas City with extensive experience in trauma, family therapy, and psychological evaluations. Website: https://drcalebstephens.com.\r\nLiz Davis, LPC � A licensed professional counselor in Kansas City with expertise in psychological assessments and therapy. Website: https://www.lizdavistherapy.com.\r\n\r\nRespondent has failed to take any steps to complete the court-ordered evaluation, refusing to schedule with the provided professionals.\r\nMovant filed a Motion to Enforce Compliance with the psychological evaluation order, which has been ignored by the Court, despite Respondent�s continued noncompliance.\r\nThe Court�s failure to enforce its order enables Respondent�s continued refusal to comply, creating an unfair and prejudicial imbalance in these proceedings.\r\nThe Court�s selective enforcement of its own directives demonstrates judicial bias and improper favor toward Respondent.\r\nMovant requests an immediate ruling requiring Respondent�s compliance before trial or, in the alternative, barring Respondent from introducing any psychological arguments due to her failure to comply with the Court�s order.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nA. Issue an immediate ruling compelling Respondent�s compliance with the psychological evaluation order, with sanctions for continued refusal; or\r\nB. Prohibit Respondent from presenting any psychological-based claims or defenses in trial due to her failure to comply; andC. Grant any further relief this Court deems just and proper.`

    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `COMES NOW the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully submits this formal objection to the cancellation of the scheduled hearing in the above-captioned case, and in support thereof states as follows:\r\nBackground: A hearing was duly scheduled for 04/04/2025, at which the Movant intended to present evidence, arguments, and motions relevant to the ongoing custody proceedings and related matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nCancellation of Hearing: On 04/03/2025, the Movant was notified that the scheduled hearing was cancelled. No prior notice or explanation regarding the cancellation was provided to the Movant, and this cancellation significantly disrupts the progress of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for Objection: The Movant respectfully objects to the cancellation of the hearing, as it violates the Movant�s right to a timely hearing under applicable law. Additionally, the cancellation of the hearing without adequate justification undermines the Movant�s ability to pursue relief and obtain a fair resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact of Cancellation: The cancellation of this hearing causes substantial prejudice to the Movant by delaying critical proceedings, including seeing Felix. The Movant has prepared for this hearing, including arranging necessary evidence, witnesses, and legal arguments, and as such, the cancellation imposes undue hardship and further delays the timely resolution of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest for Rescheduled Hearing: The Movant respectfully requests that this Court promptly reschedule the hearing at the earliest available date and allow the case to proceed without further undue delay. The Movant further requests that the Court consider the legal rights and interests at stake in this case, as well as the previous preparation and efforts made by the Movant to comply with the Court�s schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\na. Overrule the cancellation of the hearing;\r\n b. Reschedule the hearing for the earliest possible date; and\r\n c. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

    content: `It is now undeniable that this court has permitted, if not actively facilitated, perjury, fraud, and racially motivated bias against me. I am formally demanding that you immediately forward the following legal matters to the District Attorney for prosecution, as is your duty under Kansas law:\r\nPerjury by Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove, who knowingly provided false testimony regarding my residence, fabricating instability to justify depriving me of my parental rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nFraudulent Legal Conduct by Josh Garrett, who orchestrated the perjury, manipulated evidence, and intentionally suppressed exculpatory facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllegal Temporary Custody Motion by Crycella Freitag, which was submitted without legal standing and in direct violation of jurisdictional law.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial Misconduct, including the deliberate falsification of docket entries, acceptance of known perjury, and the court�s complicity in racial discrimination against me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTampering with Evidence, as an altered video was knowingly entered into the record to misrepresent my character and manipulate the court�s perception.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a matter of discretion�it is a legal obligation.

In support of this Motion, Movant states as follows:\r\nI. STRIKING OF EDITED VIDEO SUBMISSION\r\nThe court has allowed the admission of an edited and misleading video into the record, clearly intended to distort the facts and prejudice the proceedings against Movant.\r\nThis video does not meet the evidentiary standards for authentication, completeness, or fairness as required under Missouri Rules of Evidence.\r\nMovant demands that this tainted evidence be stricken from the record immediately, and that any decisions or considerations made based on its content be vacated as a violation of due process.\r\nII. REMOVAL AND NOTATION OF PREJUDICIAL DOCKET ENTRIES\r\nThe docket entries contain statements that falsely frame Movant in a negative light, demonstrating clear and intentional bias by the Court.\r\nThese docket entries do not reflect actual proceedings or facts but instead serve as a tool to manufacture an unjustified narrative against Movant.\r\nMovant demands that all prejudicial docket entries be struck and that an official notation be entered correcting these misrepresentations.\r\nIII. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PERJURY IN COURT FILINGS\r\nRespondent and her witnesses, including but not limited to Jozef Hanratty and Josh Garrett, have engaged in perjury, presenting knowingly false statements to the Court.\r\nSpecific instances of perjury include, but are not limited to:\r\nFalse testimony regarding Movant�s living situation.\r\nFraudulent claims about financial hardship to deny Movant access to his child.\r\nCollusion with third parties to present fabricated narratives contradicting verified facts.\r\nMovant demands that the Court immediately address these acts of perjury and refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for criminal investigation.\r\nIV. UNLAWFUL TEMPORARY CUSTODY ORDER MUST BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY\r\nThe Court has allowed the enforcement of a temporary custody order that is in clear violation of Missouri law, as it was issued based on procedurally defective motions that lacked legal standing and factual merit.\r\nThis order was obtained through fraudulent representations and should be voided immediately, with full custody reconsidered in favor of Movant based on the egregious conduct of the Respondent.\r\nFurthermore, Movant demands that the Court justify why it has repeatedly ignored clear violations of law and due process, which has directly harmed both Movant and the minor child.\r\nV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Honorable Court:\r\nStrike the altered video from the record and prohibit its use in any further proceedings.\r\nRemove and formally correct prejudicial docket entries that misrepresent the facts.\r\nAcknowledge perjury committed by Respondent and her witnesses and refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.\r\nImmediately vacate the unlawful temporary custody order and reconsider custody arrangements based on verified evidence.\r\nGrant any other relief this Court deems necessary and just to rectify these severe violations of due process and judicial integrity.`

    date: "2025-4-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `MOTION TO ADDRESS MANIPULATION AND NONCOMPLIANCE REGARDING COURT-ORDERED PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION\r\nCOMES NOW, Movant, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and moves this Court to acknowledge the Respondent�s and their counsel�s deliberate failure to comply with Court-ordered psychological evaluations, as well as the ongoing judicial bias and manipulation of this requirement to paint Movant in a false and negative light. In support thereof, Movant states as follows:\r\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn 12/13/2024, the Court granted a temporary custody order to Respondent based on the false premise that Movant had unstable living conditions. This was based on perjured testimony from Jozef Hanratty.\r\nThe Court explicitly stated that if Movant remained in his home beyond a week, it would prove Hanratty�s testimony was false.\r\nTwo weeks later, Movant was still in his home. The Court, instead of acknowledging this, asked Josh Garrett to confirm the claim, who falsely stated, \"Kelly Truelove wants him out!\"\r\nTwo months later, Kelly Truelove filed a fraudulent eviction lawsuit, which was immediately dismissed, confirming collusion between Respondent, her counsel, and their witnesses.\r\nOn 01/29/2025, Judge Selby continued to dismiss Movant�s evidence submissions while enabling perjury and parental alienation.\r\nInstead of correcting this injustice, Judge Selby further prejudiced Movant by ordering a psychological evaluation while ignoring Movant�s December 16, 2024 request for Respondent to undergo the same evaluation.\r\nMovant initially objected to the examiners provided by the Court due to their lack of experience with diverse families. On 02/26/2025, Movant filed a Motion to Object to Psychological Examiners.\r\nOn 03/11/2025, Judge Selby granted Movant�s motion to use alternative evaluators, and Movant promptly provided Respondent and her counsel with a list of two qualified Black psychologists.\r\nDespite agreeing to set up the evaluation, opposing counsel engaged in a pattern of obstruction, refusing to schedule the evaluation while engaging in tactics designed to entrap Movant into admitting noncompliance.\r\nMovant engaged in 36 documented email exchanges with opposing counsel, where Movant repeatedly clarified that they needed to schedule the court-ordered evaluation. Respondent and her counsel refused to do so while making sarcastic remarks and further manipulating the process.\r\nThe only evaluators suggested by opposing counsel were white psychologists, despite Movant clearly indicating their preference for an examiner with experience in diverse family dynamics.\r\nThe Court�s ongoing refusal to acknowledge this pattern of obstruction while allowing Respondent to feign compliance demonstrates judicial bias.\r\nII. ARGUMENT\r\nRespondent�s Failure to Comply: The Court ordered both parties to undergo psychological evaluations. Movant provided evaluators, yet Respondent has taken no action to comply.\r\nOpposing Counsel�s Bad Faith Tactics: Instead of complying, opposing counsel engaged in deceptive tactics to manipulate the narrative and paint Movant as noncompliant.\r\nJudicial Bias & Procedural Misconduct: The Court has ignored Movant�s motions and evidence submissions while continuously enabling Respondent�s noncompliance.\r\nDue Process Violation: The Court has denied Movant due process by selectively enforcing orders to Movant�s detriment.\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Court to:\r\nA. Issue an immediate ruling compelling Respondent to comply with the psychological evaluation order and schedule an appointment with one of the approved evaluators within seven (7) days. B. Sanction Respondent and her counsel for bad faith conduct and their deliberate attempts to obstruct compliance. C. Bar Respondent from introducing any psychological-based arguments or defenses at trial due to her failure to comply with the Court order. D. Acknowledge and correct the judicial bias demonstrated in the handling of this issue, ensuring future impartial enforcement of all court orders. E. Grant any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.`

    content: `COMES NOW, Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to strike any outstanding order or implication requiring participation in a psychological evaluation conducted by Midtown Psychological Services, and in support thereof, states the following:\r\n\r\n1. Procedural Background\r\nOn or about February 26, 2025, Movant was contacted by Midtown Psychological Services, stating they had been contacted by Sarah, an associate of the Garrett Law Firm, and had been assigned to conduct a psychological evaluation of Movant allegedly pursuant to a court order.\r\nThe provider confirmed the initial communication came solely from Respondent’s legal counsel, with no record of direct court appointment or oversight. Further, Respondent Crycella Freitag personally paid for the evaluation, a clear breach of neutrality and procedural integrity.\r\nMovant immediately requested written clarification regarding the referral process, scope of evaluation, and the provider’s neutrality. No clarification or court confirmation was received.\r\n\r\n2. Midtown Psychological Has Withdrawn\r\nOn April 9, 2025, Movant contacted Midtown Psychological Services. During this call, a representative from their office stated that Midtown Psychological has formally declined to be involved in this case and has requested that the Garrett Law Firm not contact their office again.\r\nThe provider’s withdrawal confirms that the original evaluation order was not arranged through a neutral process, but instead unilaterally initiated and funded by Respondent and her legal team.\r\n\r\n3. Request for Court Relief\r\nMovant is not opposed to participating in a psychological evaluation so long as it is:\r\nCourt-appointed through a neutral selection process, and\r\nConducted by an evaluator with no prior affiliation with either party.\r\nIn light of these developments, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nStrike any evaluation order referencing Midtown Psychological or resulting from unilateral appointment by Respondent’s counsel.\r\nIssue a new order appointing a neutral, court-selected evaluator, with costs split equitably or determined by the Court.\r\n\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the relief requested above, strike the existing referral to Midtown Psychological Services, and appoint a neutral psychological evaluator in accordance with fair and impartial procedures.`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to vacate its order requiring evaluation by Midtown Psychological Services (\"Midtown\") for the following reasons:\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\nThe Court’s order conditioned any custody modification on Movant completing an evaluation with Midtown—a provider now unavailable due to their refusal to work with Respondent’s counsel (Garrett Law Firm) for ethical reasons.\r\nMidtown’s rejection of Garrett Law Firm confirms:\r\nThe evaluation process was tainted by Respondent’s counsel’s misconduct.\r\nThe Court’s order is now impossible to comply with, as Midtown will not proceed.\r\nThe Court’s linkage of custody to this evaluation punishes Movant for Respondent’s counsel’s actions and violates due process.\r\n\r\nII. LEGAL GROUNDS\r\nA. The Evaluation Order is Void Due to Impossibility\r\nMO Rule 68.01: Court-ordered evaluations must be neutral. Midtown’s withdrawal proves the process was compromised.\r\nMO Supreme Court Precedent: Orders requiring impossible acts (e.g., evaluations with conflicted providers) are unenforceable (State ex rel. M.D.K., 445 S.W.3d 543 (Mo. App. 2014)).\r\n\r\nB. The Garrett Law Firm’s Misconduct Invalided the Process\r\nMidtown’s refusal to work with Garrett Law Firm after payment from Respondent confirms:\r\nEx parte coordination between Respondent’s counsel and the evaluator.\r\nFinancial bias (Respondent pre-paid Midtown before the order issued).\r\n\r\nC. The Court’s Custody Condition is Retaliatory\r\nThe Court’s sole reason for denying modification was Movant’s non-compliance with Midtown’s evaluation—an evaluation now proven unethical.\r\nConditioning custody on a tainted evaluation violates fundamental fairness (In re Marriage of Denton, 169 S.W.3d 604 (Mo. App. 2005)).\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nMovant respectfully requests:\r\nAn order vacating the requirement to undergo evaluation with Midtown Psychological Services.\r\nA finding that Respondent’s counsel’s actions rendered the evaluation process void ab initio.\r\nPermission to seek an independent evaluator from a court-approved panel, with costs borne by Respondent due to her counsel’s misconduct.\r\nAn immediate hearing on custody modification, as the Court’s prior condition is now moot.\r\nIV. CONCLUSION\r\nThe Court cannot enforce an order premised on an unethical, impossible act. Movant seeks justice untainted by Garrett Law Firm’s bad-faith tactics.`

    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this formal notice and demand for judicial correction in response to the Court's prior directive regarding the psychological evaluation at Midtown Psychological Associates, and the Court’s continued failure to issue rulings on properly filed and documented motions.\r\nOn the record during the hearing held on or about 4/9/2025 9:00am, the Honorable Judge Matt Alan Selby directly threatened the undersigned with contempt if he did not obtain a psychological evaluation specifically from Midtown Psychological Associates.\r\n\r\nOn the record during the hearing, Judge Selby threatened to end the hearing every time Movant tried to correct the record, or defend himself making it an impossible environment of recognized biased rulings.   \r\n\r\nMovant has made every good faith effort to comply with this directive. However, Midtown Psychological Associates has explicitly refused to provide services due to their policy of not working with Garrett Law Firm, who represents Respondent. This makes compliance with the Court's directive factually and legally impossible.\r\n\r\nDespite multiple filings and full documentation disproving every harmful allegation made against the Movant, the Court has failed to rule on any of Movant’s motions, and have not provided any future hearings without explanation or notice of rescheduling.\r\n\r\nThe Court’s refusal to acknowledge or correct its misdirected contempt threats and procedural errors has created a situation of ongoing prejudice, harm, and constitutional deprivation to Movant, who remains unable to exercise custodial rights due to this unresolved matter.\r\n\r\nEach day this error is left uncorrected, it further compounds the damage to Movant’s legal position, personal stability, and most critically his relationship with the minor child.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no legal or factual justification for the continued separation of the minor child, Felix, from Movant. All previous allegations have been disproven or rendered moot, and yet no hearing is scheduled. This flagrant delay in justice and access to due process constitutes a continuing violation of Movant’s civil rights under color of state law, and may give rise to federal review or civil rights litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\r\nKelly Truelove played a critical role in validating false claims about Micheal’s housing stability during custody proceedings, despite lacking a direct rental agreement with him. Her decision to proceed with eviction efforts, combined with her refusal to clarify her communication boundaries and reliance on Jozef Hanratty’s authority, suggests possible coordination with Crycella Freitag and Josh Garrett. Given Josh Garrett's on-record statements attributing key information to Kelly, and her indirect influence on custody-related narratives, it is essential to subpoena all text message records between Kelly Truelove, Crycella Freitag, and Josh Garrett to determine the extent of collusion, perjury, or strategic misrepresentation intended to harm Micheal’s parental rights.\r\nAdditionally, the Court has failed to forward documented allegations against Jozef Hanratty to the appropriate prosecutorial authorities, despite multiple filings identifying three clear instances of perjury, committed knowingly and willfully during custody proceedings. The police previously issued a verbal warning to Mr. Hanratty regarding his involvement, yet he continued to inject himself into the litigation, materially influencing the case with demonstrable falsehoods. The Court's refusal to act or refer the matter to the District Attorney further obstructs the proper administration of justice and emboldens continued abuse of the legal process.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant demands immediate judicial correction of the record regarding the threatened contempt, psychological evaluation and the immediate scheduling of a hearing on the outstanding motions and issues.`

    title: "EMERGENCY MOTION FOR JUDICIAL CORRECTION, HEARING REQUEST, AND SANCTIONS FOR MISREPRESENTATION OF COURT-ASSOCIATED PROVIDER",
    date: "2025-10-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to take immediate judicial corrective action and schedule an emergency hearing in light of ongoing violations of due process, false representations made by opposing counsel regarding third-party service providers, and the resulting deprivation of Movant’s custodial access. In support thereof, Movant states the following:\r\n\r\nI. IMMEDIATE ISSUE: USE OF NON-EXISTENT ENTITY TO OBSTRUCT REUNIFICATION\r\nThe entity referred to as \"KidCentric\" has been referenced in prior discussions related to court-ordered services or evaluations in this case.\r\nUpon investigation, there is no active or registered business operating under the name \"KidCentric\" in the State of Kansas. The only such entity was forfeited and administratively dissolved.\r\nMovant was placed in a position of relying on this non-existent provider for crucial services affecting his custodial rights, including but not limited to visitation facilitation and psychological evaluation pathways.\r\nThis constitutes material misrepresentation by opposing counsel and/or a grave procedural error by the Court, as no party should be ordered or expected to comply with an order that references a defunct or non-operational entity.\r\n\r\nII. EVALUATION PROVIDER IS REFUSING CONTACT DUE TO JOSH GARRETT\r\nThe Court additionally ordered Movant to obtain a psychological evaluation through Midtown Psychological Associates, and threatened contempt if he failed to comply.\r\nMovant made every good faith effort to schedule said evaluation; however, Midtown Psychological Associates has explicitly refused to provide services due to their refusal to work with Garrett Law Firm, who represents Respondent.\r\nThis renders the evaluation directive legally and practically impossible to comply with, through no fault of the Movant.\r\nYet, Movant remains under the implied threat of contempt and suffers continued separation from his son, Felix, without legal basis.\r\n\r\nIII. COURT’S FAILURE TO SCHEDULE A HEARING OR RULE ON MOTIONS\r\nThe Court has failed to respond to or act upon multiple properly filed and time-sensitive emergency motions submitted by the Movant, including those requesting corrections, protective orders, and judicial review of procedural errors.\r\nThe Court has also removed all scheduled hearings without rescheduling or notice, leaving the Movant in a state of procedural limbo with no avenue to be heard and removed all phone contact allowing Movant no way to contact Felix.\r\nThis denial of access to the Court, coupled with the refusal to correct directives that are impossible to comply with, has resulted in a flagrant deprivation of Movant’s due process and parental rights under both the Missouri Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\r\n\r\nIV. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MISCONDUCT BY OPPOSING COUNSEL\r\nOpposing counsel, Josh Garrett, has made repeated misrepresentations to the Court and has leveraged false narratives—including the Layne Project cancellation and \"KidCentric\" mislabeling—to paint the Movant as unstable or non-compliant.\r\nMr. Garrett knowingly omitted exculpatory evidence showing that Crycella Freitag refused to pay for court-ordered visitation at Layne Project, and later used that cancellation to push for an unjustified psychological evaluation through a provider who now refuses contact with his firm.\r\n\r\nThis conduct constitutes bad faith litigation, obstruction, and possibly fraud upon the court, warranting sanctions and referral to the appropriate disciplinary body.\r\n\r\nV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests the following:\r\nThat the Court schedule an emergency hearing within seven (7) days to address the false representation of \"KidCentric\" and the impossibility of complying with the psychological evaluation order;\r\nThat the Court formally strike or correct any orders involving non-existent or defunct entities, and issue a revised evaluation directive through a neutral and available provider;\r\nThat the Court order immediate restoration of unsupervised parenting time until such time as lawful procedures are properly followed;\r\nThat the Court issue sanctions against Josh Garrett for misrepresentation, bad faith, and suppression of exculpatory evidence; and\r\nThat the Court provide immediate clarity regarding all outstanding motions and scheduling, so as to prevent further deprivation of Movant’s rights under color of law.`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this emergency motion for judicial correction and relief, and for the immediate scheduling of a hearing regarding the inclusion of “KidCentric” as a referenced entity in this case. Movant further seeks clarification, protection, and relief against continued procedural obstruction, as this provider has now been confirmed to be unregistered, unlicensed, and uncooperative—resulting in a complete denial of access to the minor child and violation of the Movant’s constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nI. BACKGROUND AND COMMUNICATION RECORD\r\nOn April 10, 2025, Movant made a final effort to contact \"KidCentric\" after six prior failed attempts. A response was received from a personal cell phone (785-424-3700), identifying the speaker only as “Julie,” who claimed to be the director of KidCentric.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Movant asked for formal business verification, license, or legal documentation of this provider’s standing, “Julie” refused to provide any such documentation, stating, quote, “You can find what you need online. I am not providing any physical documents to you.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon being pressed for documentation or confirmation of the entity’s legitimacy, she threatened to block Movant and further stated, quote, “I will advise the court I will not be providing services for you,” without stating why or how.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic records show no registered, active business under the name “KidCentric” in Kansas, and the only such business has been forfeited. No verifiable business license, EIN, or professional affiliation has been disclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interaction is consistent with fraudulent activity, or at a minimum, an unregulated service attempting to influence judicial proceedings without accountability, documentation, or transparency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DUE PROCESS VIOLATION AND COMPLETE DENIAL OF ACCESS\r\nThe Court’s reliance on \"KidCentric\" or any affiliated actor has now resulted in a total shutdown of reunification and communication between Movant and the minor child.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, in conjunction with Midtown Psychological Associates’ refusal to coordinate with Garrett Law Firm, has rendered all court-ordered options for compliance and parenting time functionally and legally impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no court date set to resolve these critical issues, despite multiple emergency motions filed, and Movant is being denied access to his child based entirely on fabricated and unlawful third-party involvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests the following:\r\nThat the Court issue an immediate order striking any reference to “KidCentric” or its alleged representatives from the record and from any future orders or considerations;\r\n\r\nThat the Court order an investigation into the nature of the service, including any statements made by “KidCentric” to the Court and whether they were initiated by or in coordination with opposing counsel;\r\n\r\nThat the Court schedule an emergency hearing within seven (7) days to review this obstruction, reset service provider arrangements through a neutral and verified party, and address the ongoing constitutional violations facing the Movant;\r\n\r\nThat opposing counsel be held accountable for presenting, supporting, or coordinating with non-licensed entities, and that sanctions be considered if the obstruction is found to be strategic or knowing;\r\n\r\nThat Movant’s access to his child be restored immediately or a pathway be established through legitimate and legally accountable channels, not fabricated or unverifiable third parties.`

    content: `COMES NOW Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for emergency relief based on the following facts and supporting legal standards:\r\n\r\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn April 12, 2025, Brook Gipson (MO Bar #72816) was appointed as Guardian ad Litem for the minor child, Felix Day Salmon.\r\nAs of April 16, 2025�five full days since appointment�Movant has received no contact or acknowledgment from Ms. Gipson.\r\nMovant has made numerous attempts to initiate contact, including:\r\n\r\n\r\nCalls to Ms. Gipson�s law office\r\nDirect communication with her secretary\r\nMultiple email correspondences\r\n\r\n\r\nThese attempts are fully documented and time-stamped in Movant�s public Legal Audit App available at:\r\n https://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html\r\nMs. Gipson�s complete failure to initiate communication is a direct violation of her obligations under Missouri Revised Statute � 452.423, which states:\r\n �The guardian ad litem shall be the legal representative of the child and may, when appropriate, present evidence and recommendations to the court concerning the best interests of the child.�\r\n This presumes actual engagement with the parties and investigation�neither of which have occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. JUDICIAL REMARKS INDICATING BIAS AND PROCEDURAL ABUSE\r\nAt the last hearing, the Court stated on record its refusal to alter the temporary custody order \"no matter what.\"\r\nThe Court also expressed intent to dismiss the case and allow the GAL�s final recommendations to stand uncontested.\r\nThese statements, paired with the GAL�s dereliction of duty, result in a complete denial of Movant�s right to due process and fair adjudication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND IRREPARABLE HARM\r\nMovant asserts that the ongoing deprivation of parent-child contact, with direct assistance or willful neglect by the Court and GAL, constitutes a state-sponsored deprivation of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution, actionable under 42 U.S. Code �?1983.\r\nRespondent's behavior�denying all contact with Felix for nearly three months�amounts to parental alienation, compounded by: The Court�s refusal to enforce access or review new evidence, The GAL�s failure to initiate contact, investigate, or act in the child�s best interest, Public officers exercising authority under color of state law to enable this deprivation\r\nThese combined actions violate the substantive and procedural due process rights of both Movant and the minor child under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nMoreover, Movant contends that these officials have acted with deliberate indifference, and seeks the record to reflect a notice of intent to pursue federal civil rights action under: 42 U.S. Code � 1983 � Civil action for deprivation of rights, 42 U.S. Code � 1985 � Conspiracy to interfere with civil rights, Kansas and Missouri Human Rights Acts, as applicable, U.S. Supreme Court precedent: Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982) � heightened protections in parental rights termination, Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) � fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of children\r\nStanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972) � unwed fathers have equal constitutional protection to custody\r\nIV. NOTICE OF FEDERAL ACTION AND PRESERVATION OF RECORDS\r\nMovant places this Court and all parties on formal notice of his intent to pursue federal civil rights litigation related to: Judicial misconduct, GAL dereliction of duty, Ongoing parental rights violations \r\nV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nMovant respectfully requests the following:\r\nA. That this Court compel Guardian ad Litem Brook Gipson to initiate contact with Movant within three (3) business days, and file a formal progress report within three (3) business days, or be disqualified and replaced for cause;\r\nB. That this Court schedule an emergency hearing to address:\r\nThe GAL�s failure to perform her duties\r\nCrycella�s willful interference with custody and communication\r\nThis Court�s prior statements regarding refusal to consider factual changes\r\nC. That this Court grant immediate, court-ordered contact between Micheal and Felix, via custody order modification;\r\nD. That the Court preserve the record for appellate review, as these actions (or inactions) may constitute judicial misconduct and/or procedural deprivation.`

    date: "2025-17-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `Comes now, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Movant and natural father of Felix Day Salmon, and respectfully submits this Motion to preserve a clear record of procedural violations, fraudulent representations, and denial of due process now ongoing in this matter.\r\n\r\nI. FRAUDULENT GUARDIAN AD LITEM APPOINTMENT\r\nOn or about April 12, 2025, the Court purported to appoint Brook Gipson as Guardian ad Litem (GAL) in this matter.\r\nDespite diligent efforts to confirm her identity, Movant has been unable to locate any record of Brook Gipson on Missouri Case.net, on file with the Missouri Bar, or via direct contact with either Ozarks Law Firm or Rooney McBride & Smith, who have repeatedly made conflicting and evasive claims regarding her identity.\r\nGiven the total lack of professional footprint, the Movant reasonably believes that no such individual actively serves as GAL, and that this appointment may have been fictitious.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovant reserves the right to issue a subpoena in future discovery or appeal to compel testimony from the above firms, and from the Court itself if necessary, regarding the existence and participation of �Brook Gipson.�\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. COURT DELAY STRATEGY TO EVADE REVIEW\r\nMovant places on the record that Judge Matt Alan Selby, in open court, stated:\r\n �It�s getting close to the six-month rule, and I�m planning on dismissing.�\r\nThis comment, paired with the ongoing refusal to schedule or rule on Movant�s valid motions, indicates a deliberate strategy to delay adjudication long enough to dismiss this case on a technicality�despite jurisdictional objections and ongoing violations of Movant�s parental rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE MOTION DAYS OR RULE ON MOTIONS\r\nPer Stone County Local Rule 2.4.1, today�April 17, 2025�is a designated Motion Day for Associate Division II.\r\nMovant�s Emergency Motion, filed in advance and compliant with docket requirements, was intentionally omitted from the docket.\r\nThe Clerk�s Office falsely told Movant the next hearing date was May 2, 2025, which is not a Motion Day for this division.\r\nThis is a direct violation of Rule 2.4.1, designed to obstruct access to relief and further enable dismissal without hearing the evidence.\r\n\r\nIV. NO ACCESS TO CHILD, NO LEGAL REMEDY\r\nMovant has been completely denied access to his son, Felix Day Salmon, despite multiple filings and attempts to resolve issues peacefully.\r\nThe court-sanctioned facility for visitation�KidCentric�has been proven a fraudulent or inactive entity.\r\nDespite clear evidence, the Court refuses to take judicial notice of this or hold any hearings to address Movant�s inability to even see his child under the current order.\r\nThese failures constitute a deprivation of fundamental rights, exacerbated by the Court�s inaction.\r\nV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF (FOR THE RECORD)\r\nMovant acknowledges this Motion will likely be ignored by the Court, as previous filings have been. Nevertheless, for purposes of appeal, legal audit, and potential federal review, Movant requests:\r\nA written response confirming whether �Brook Gipson� is a real person, licensed attorney, and active GAL;\r\nA ruling on Movant�s Emergency Motion filed prior to April 17 Motion Day;\r\nAn order compelling confirmation of a real visitation path, including whether KidCentric exists or is legally operational;\r\nAny explanation from the Court as to why motions are not being heard despite being filed and compliant with local rules.\r\nVI. NOTICE OF PARALLEL ACTION AND RESERVED RIGHTS\r\nMovant further notifies this Court that he is initiating parallel legal proceedings in the State of Kansas, the child�s true home state pursuant to UCCJEA standards. Movant expressly reserves all rights to use evidence, transcripts, and filings from this Missouri proceeding in related or future litigation�including to expose misconduct, perjury, or fraud by the opposing party or associated counsel. However, due to Missouri�s lack of jurisdiction and ongoing procedural violations, no rulings, findings, or dismissals from this Court shall be construed to prejudice or interfere with the Kansas proceedings, nor shall they limit Movant�s legal remedies or standing therein.`

    title: "MOTION TO STRIKE DECLINED APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIAN AD LITEM, AND PRESERVE RECORD FOR SANCTIONS AND CIVIL ACTION",
    date: "2025-21-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully requests this Court to strike the recently filed �Declination� of Guardian ad Litem Brooke D. Gipson, filed by Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC, in tandem with Ozarks Legal and for the immediate dismissal of Case No. 24SN-DR00104. This Motion is made on the basis of materially false statements, documented misconduct, and ethical violations presented in the filing submitted by Ms. Gipson�s firms. In support of this Motion, Movant states the following:\r\n\r\n1. Procedural Timeline Proves Fabrication\r\nBrooke D. Gipson was appointed Guardian ad Litem by this Court on April 12, 2025.\r\nThe Declination, submitted by Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC, states that Movant called the firm \"within the last two days before the guardian could even officially accept the appointment\"�i.e., April 10 or prior.\r\nTherefore, any interaction alleged occurred before Ms. Gipson�s appointment�when she had no role, duty, or standing in the case.\r\nThis alone invalidates the claim of conflict of interest and undermines the entire basis for declination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Recorded Communication Contradicts Their Claims\r\nThe firm claims Movant �called multiple times, yelled at staff, and threatened to sue the firm.� This is categorically false.\r\nEvery call was recorded. The tone remains professional throughout. No yelling occurred.\r\nThe �threat� referenced was a statement that if the firm refused to acknowledge or respond to lawful inquiry, Movant would be forced to subpoena their records and potentially seek legal remedy.\r\nThis is not a threat�it is due process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Ethical and Legal Issues with the Filing\r\nThe Declination was signed with a typed font signature (Lobster font) rather than a real, verifiable signature from Ms. Gipson. On the back, it was just italics in Arial.\r\nUnder Missouri Supreme Court Rule 55.03 and Rule 4-3.3, submitting filings containing falsehoods and improper signatures may constitute sanctionable conduct and grounds for discipline.\r\nThe firm�s filing constitutes an intentional misrepresentation to the court, and appears to serve no purpose other than to:\r\nAvoid court-appointed duties.\r\nSmear the Movant�s character.\r\nCreate unnecessary delay and confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Pattern of Obstruction\r\nThis conduct is consistent with a broader pattern of obstruction and bad faith exhibited by parties aligned with Movant throughout this matter.\r\nGAL services are meant to serve the best interests of the child�not the strategic convenience of a party or their affiliated professionals.\r\nMs. Gipson and her firm never contacted Movant, and no communication was initiated before filing this declination�further demonstrating the filing was retaliatory and defensive, not professional or neutral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Public Record and Civil Action Reserved\r\nThis exchange, including audio files and the original filed letter, www.SalmonAudit.info\r\nMovant explicitly reserves the right to pursue civil damages against Ozarks Law, Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC and Brooke D. Gipson for:\r\nDefamation.\r\nFiling materially false statements with the court.\r\nProcedural sabotage of a custody case involving a minor child.\r\nMovant also reserves the right to file a formal complaint with the Missouri Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel for ethical violations pursuant to Rules 4-3.1, 4-3.3, and 4-8.4(c).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nStrike the GAL Declination filed by Brooke D. Gipson;\r\nIssue an order acknowledging the timeline and fabricated nature of the claims within the Declination;\r\nPreserve the record for potential sanctions or further proceedings involving misconduct;\r\nGrant Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Full physical and Sole custody of Minor Felix Day Salmon.\r\nAttachments:\r\nExhibit A: Declination Letter from Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC`

    title: "EMERGENCY MOTION FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE OF PROCEDURAL DEFAULT, FOR IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF CUSTODY, AND FOR CLARIFICATION OF JURISDICTIONAL RIGHTS TO PURSUE PERJURY-BASED CLAIMS IN KANSAS",
    date: "2025-21-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the undersigned Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to take Judicial Notice of Procedural Default and to immediately issue an order for full custodial transfer of the minor child, Felix Day Salmon, to Petitioner, for the reasons stated below:\r\n\r\nI. PROCEDURAL DEFAULT & ABANDONMENT OF DUTY\r\nThe Guardian ad Litem originally appointed by this Court, Brooke D. Gibson of Rooney McBride & Smith, LLC, has filed a formal decline of appointment dated April 18, 2025, citing fabricated conduct unsupported by fact and in direct contradiction to recorded interactions now entered into evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo substitute Guardian ad Litem has been appointed since her declination, despite this Court being aware of the urgent necessity due to the pending final hearing, serious allegations of parental alienation, and legal misconduct affecting the welfare of the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis failure constitutes a procedural default under Missouri Supreme Court Rules 68.01 and Rule 129.02, as the child's right to representation has been effectively ignored by the Court for over 70 days since the initial order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. EVIDENT COLLUSION, PERJURY, AND JURISDICTIONAL SPILLOVER FROM KANSAS\r\nPetitioner provides notice that matters arising from this case are not confined to Missouri jurisdiction. A series of acts involving fraud, perjury, and collusion�including testimony and sworn statements by Carolyn Salmon, the Layne Project, Crycella Freitag, Stephanie Reed, Natasha Kluttz, Kelly Truelove and Jozef Hanratty�are directly tied to the deprivation of the Petitioner�s parental rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese acts occurred primarily in Wyandotte County, Kansas, where Felix resided for the majority of his life, and where multiple witnesses lied to both courts and law enforcement to create the false appearance of instability.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegardless of Missouri's continued silence, Petitioner reserves all rights to prosecute and subpoena individuals under Kansas law and intends to pursue civil and criminal accountability where Missouri fails to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EMERGENCY REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF CUSTODY\r\nIn light of:\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Court�s abandonment of its duty to appoint a GAL,\r\n\r\n\r\nthe lack of any communication from the Court despite multiple motions,\r\n\r\n\r\nthe now-confirmed procedural and ethical misconduct within this Court�s jurisdiction,\r\n\r\n\r\nand ongoing harm to Felix due to protracted delay and parental deprivation,\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner hereby demands immediate full legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon.\r\nPetitioner is willing to offer Respondent, Crycella T. D., four (4) hours of unsupervised parenting time per week pending further court review, but asserts this shall not delay enforcement of this emergency custody order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. CONCLUSION\r\nThis Court has entered a state of inaction that has materially harmed the child, denied Petitioner due process, and allowed misinformation and unlawful behavior to persist unchecked. Therefore, Petitioner respectfully demands:\r\nJudicial acknowledgment of procedural default under Missouri rules;\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediate granting of full custody to Petitioner;\r\n\r\n\r\nAffirmation of Petitioner�s right to pursue legal recourse in Kansas regarding perjury and fraud in connection to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA copy of all referenced communications, including recorded calls disproving the GAL�s stated basis for declining appointment, is appended and cataloged at:\r\n\r\nhttps://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html`

    title: "MOTION TO APPEAR VIA WEBEX FOR ALL UPCOMING HEARINGS",
    date: "2025-23-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Petitioner pro se, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to permit remote appearance via Webex for the following scheduled proceedings:\r\nPre-Trial Conference � May 2, 2025 at 11:00 AM\r\nCourt Trial � May 9, 2025 at 10:00 AM\r\n(Unnoticed Hearing) � April 28, 2025 at 10:00 AM (appears in docket but was not timely or explicitly served)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn support of this Motion, Petitioner states the following:\r\nLack of Proper Service: The hearing scheduled for April 28, 2025 at 10:00 AM was embedded within docket activity and not reasonably presented to Petitioner in a manner compliant with due process. Petitioner only became aware of this entry by cross-referencing mailed materials with docket entries after the fact.\r\nFinancial and Logistical Hardship: Petitioner resides in Kansas City, Kansas, and travel to the Stone County Courthouse imposes a significant burden both financially and logistically. Petitioner is also solely responsible for the care of minor child Felix Day Salmon when not obstructed.\r\nDue Process and Oversight Considerations: Given ongoing procedural irregularities, including substantial issues surrounding the performance and qualifications of the recently appointed Guardian ad Litem, Attorney Mark Stephens, Petitioner intends to raise substantive concerns with the Court in a subsequent motion. Remote appearance is requested to ensure full participation while Petitioner prepares filings related to those concerns, which directly affect trial fairness.\r\nPrecedent for Remote Hearings: Missouri courts have continued to endorse the use of video conferencing in domestic matters post-COVID for efficiency and accessibility, especially where a party appears pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nGrant leave to appear via Webex or equivalent virtual platform for the April 28, May 2, and May 9, 2025 hearings;\r\nProvide Petitioner with the corresponding Webex access links or information at least 72 hours in advance of each proceeding;\r\nTake judicial notice of the irregular notice practices in this matter which could affect procedural fairness.`

    title: "MOTION TO NOTIFY THE COURT OF ONGOING BEHAVIORAL PATTERN INVOLVING EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR MINOR CHILD",
    date: "2025-24-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully notifies this Honorable Court of a repeated behavioral pattern by the Respondent, Crycella Freitag, which directly impacts the minor child, Felix Day Salmon, causing emotional distress and unnecessary restriction, as follows:\nIncident Description:\nOn or about 4\/24\/2025, during the only allowed parenting time with Felix, the minor child Felix was audibly heard and seen slamming his hands against a door and screaming from inside a bedroom, attempting to exit. Petitioner directly observed and documented this behavior as a clear sign of distress and desire to leave the restricted environment.\nPetitioner's Attempt to Intervene:\nPetitioner immediately requested that Respondent allow the child to exit the room, both to alleviate distress and to determine the reason for Felix's emotional state. Respondent refused to allow the child out, disregarding the child's physical signals and Petitioner's reasonable request.\nPattern of Behavior:\nThis is not an isolated occurrence. The refusal to allow Felix to exit a room, despite emotional signals and repeated cries, is part of a broader, ongoing pattern of restrictive and emotionally dismissive behavior by Respondent. Petitioner asserts that such behavior is emotionally harmful, suppresses the minor child's agency and safety, and contributes to a toxic environment.\nRequest for Judicial Notice and Inclusion in Record:\nPetitioner respectfully requests the Court to take judicial notice of this incident and include it in the behavioral history relevant to custody and visitation decisions. Further, Petitioner requests the Court to consider this pattern when determining the best interest of the child and to permit further documentation of these events in Petitioner's legal audit archive, available at SalmonAudit.info, which maintains a chronological, evidenced-based public record of all relevant incidents.\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays this Court acknowledge the incident as evidence of an escalating pattern of obstruction, consider this in future custody determinations, and grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

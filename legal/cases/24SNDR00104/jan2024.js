      date: "2024-2-12",
      type: "Motion",
      status: "Overruled",
      content: `TO THE HONORABLE COURT:
  I, Michael Salmon, appearing Pro Se, respectfully move this Court to transfer venue for this case from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience of all parties and witnesses, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).
  
  I. Introduction
  This motion seeks to transfer venue to the District of Kansas, where both parties currently reside, to reduce undue burdens on the parties and ensure efficient resolution of this matter. The current venue in Missouri imposes significant logistical and financial challenges, making it impractical for the parties and witnesses.
  
  II. Factual Background
  1. Parties’ Residences:
     - I, Michael Salmon, reside at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas, 66103.
     - The Plaintiff, Crycella Freitag, resides in Pomona, Kansas.
  2. Current Venue Impact:
     - The current venue in Missouri is over four hours away from both parties’ homes, making travel difficult.
  3. Efforts to Cooperate:
     - I relocated from Missouri to Kansas to facilitate co-parenting and reduce travel burdens, moving within 40 minutes of the Plaintiff.
  4. Personal and Community Ties in Kansas:
     - Our two-year-old son, Felix, attends a Montessori school and is actively involved in community activities in Kansas, including church and friendships.
     - Both families reside in Kansas, making it a more practical location for witness testimonies.
  5. Financial and Work Constraints:
     - As a full-time single father, taking time off work to travel four hours each way for court proceedings is unfeasible.
     - The Plaintiff also works full-time, making a Missouri venue equally burdensome.
  
  III. Legal Standard
  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), this Court may transfer a case for the convenience of the parties and witnesses, and in the interest of justice. Factors to consider include:
  1. The convenience of the parties and witnesses;
  2. Access to sources of proof;
  3. The plaintiff’s choice of forum;
  4. Practical challenges of conducting the trial in the chosen forum;
  5. Local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.
  
  IV. Argument
  1. Convenience of the Parties:
     - Both parties reside in Kansas and would face significant hardship traveling to Missouri for court appearances. Transferring the case to Kansas reduces logistical burdens for both.
  2. Convenience of Witnesses:
     - Both parties’ families and potential witnesses reside in Kansas, minimizing travel for them and ensuring better participation.
  3. Access to Evidence:
     - Relevant evidence, such as Felix’s school records and community ties, is more readily available in Kansas.
  4. Local Interest:
     - Kansas has a strong local interest in adjudicating this matter, as both parties and their child reside and participate in the Kansas community.
  5. Interest of Justice:
     - Transferring the case aligns with fairness, reduces financial and logistical hardships, and supports the co-parenting relationship.
  
  V. Conclusion
  For the reasons stated, I, Michael Salmon, respectfully request that this Court transfer venue of this case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses.`

      status: "Granted",
      content: `COMES NOW the Respondent, Michael Lawrence Salmon, and responds to the Emergency Motion for Temporary Custody filed by the Petitioner, Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, in the above-captioned matter. In support of this response, Respondent states as follows:
  
  1. Primary Custody:
     Respondent has been the primary caregiver for the minor child, Felix Salmon, for the past two years. During this time, Felix has developed a stable routine and schedule with Respondent, which has been crucial to his well-being and development.
  
  2. Concerns Regarding Petitioner’s Home:

      status: "Pending",
      content: `To: The Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel
  Subject: Formal Complaint Against Joshua L. Garrett
  From: Michael Lawrence Salmon
  Address: 4120 Adams St, Kansas City, Kansas 66103
  Date: December 16, 2024
  
  Introduction:
  I am filing a formal complaint against attorney Joshua L. Garrett for unethical professional conduct in his representation of my ex-partner, Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, in our ongoing child custody matter concerning our son, Felix Salmon.
  
  Specific Instances of Misconduct:
  1. Deliberate Obstruction of Co-Parenting Communication:
     - In November 2024, Mr. Garrett advised Crycella to cease all communication with me, which resulted in:
       a. Complete cessation of discussions about Felix's care and upbringing.
       b. Refusal to provide financial information related to our child's support.
       c. Intentional withholding of critical parenting and residential information.
     - This advice has systematically undermined my ability to co-parent effectively and share responsibilities for our child's well-being.
  
  2. Facilitation of Manipulative Communication Tactics:
     - Following Mr. Garrett's advice, our interactions have devolved into:
       a. Intentionally confrontational exchanges.
       b. Calculated attempts to provoke or entrap me.
       c. Deliberate creation of a hostile communication environment.
  
  3. Enabling False Safety Claims:
     - A particularly egregious incident occurred when Crycella claimed to feel "unsafe" while:
       a. Voluntarily present in my home.
       b. Situated in my bedroom.
       c. In the presence of our children.
     - When I sought clarification about this sudden claim, she refused to provide any substantive explanation. This baseless allegation appears designed to:
       a. Damage my reputation as a parent.
       b. Undermine my relationship with our children.
       c. Weaponize unfounded safety concerns.
  
  4. Pattern of Racial Weaponization:
     - This is not an isolated incident. Previously, Crycella attempted to:
       a. Take Felix across state lines without my knowledge or consent.
       b. Involve law enforcement with fabricated claims of danger.
       c. Leverage her position as a white woman to potentially harm my parental rights as a Black father.
     - Mr. Garrett's continued legal counsel appears to tacitly encourage and enable these harmful tactics.
  
  Violations of Professional Ethics:
  I believe Mr. Garrett has violated multiple professional conduct rules:
  1. Rule 4.4 – Respect for Rights of Third Persons:
     - Providing advice that disregards the well-being of our child.
     - Causing significant harm to co-parental communication.
  2. Rule 1.2 – Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority:
     - Advising client to cease essential communication.
     - Actions directly contrary to the best interests of the minor child.
  3. Rule 8.4 – Misconduct:
     - Engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.
     - Promoting tactics involving false allegations and manipulation.
  
  Impact on Family Dynamics:
  The consequences of Mr. Garrett's unethical guidance include:
  1. Emotional distress for our child, Felix.
  2. Systematic destruction of co-parental communication.
  3. Potential long-term psychological harm from persistent conflict.
  
  Requested Action:
  I formally request that the Bar Association:
  1. Thoroughly investigate Mr. Garrett's professional conduct.
  2. Consider appropriate disciplinary measures.
  3. Mandate cessation of tactics that obstruct meaningful co-parenting.
  
  Conclusion:
  As the primary goal of any custody arrangement should be the child's best interest, Mr. Garrett's actions have systematically undermined this fundamental principle. I trust the Bar Association will take these serious allegations seriously and take appropriate action.`

    content: `Witness Name: Jozef Hanratty\r\nAddress: 4120 Adams St, Kansas City, Kansas 66103\r\nCOMES NOW the undersigned, Jozef Hanratty, and provides this witness statement regarding\r\nthe interactions and behavior of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards Michael Lawrence Salmon.\r\nThe following statements are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief:\r\nGaslighting Behavior\r\n1. On several occasions, I heard Crycella Elizabeth Freitag state to Michael Lawrence\r\nSalmon:\r\n? "You don’t have the right to know anything about me, my finances, or where I\r\nwant to take Felix."\r\n? "You don’t need to know where Felix stays, and I don’t need to show you pictures\r\nof our time together."\r\n\r\n2. These statements were made in a dismissive and confrontational tone, seemingly\r\nintended to belittle Michael and undermine his valid concerns about Felix's well-being.\r\nOmission of Critical Information\r\n1. Crycella Elizabeth Freitag explicitly refused to provide Michael with vital information\r\nabout her finances and Felix’s care, stating:\r\n? "No, until I get what I want, you won’t get any help from me."\r\n2. Furthermore, she accused Michael of making her feel "unsafe" without providing any\r\nexplanation or justification for these claims.\r\nLying and Interruptions\r\n1. I observed Crycella frequently interrupting Michael during discussions, accusing him of\r\nlying and refusing to listen to his responses.\r\n2. Despite these interruptions, Michael remained calm and transparent in his\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nTransparency and Hospitality by Michael Lawrence Salmon\r\n1. Michael invited Crycella into his home and maintained open communication to facilitate\r\nco-parenting and transparency.\r\n2. Despite his efforts, Crycella continued her dismissive and uncooperative behavior.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on my observations, the behavior exhibited by Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards\r\nMichael Lawrence Salmon was manipulative, dismissive, and designed to escalate tension\r\nunnecessarily. I attest to witnessing the above-described events and am prepared to provide\r\nadditional information or testimony as required.`

    content: `Witness Name: Anya Hill\r\nAddress: Resides with Crycella Freitag\r\nCOMES NOW, the undersigned, Anya Hill, and provides this witness statement regarding the\r\ninteractions and behavior of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards Micheal Lawrence Salmon, as\r\nobserved by me during the past few years. Although I am only 12 years old, I have lived with\r\nMicheal for the last seven years and have witnessed much of what has occurred. The following\r\nis true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief:\r\n1. Relationship with Micheal Lawrence Salmon:\r\n? While Micheal is not my biological father, he has been a significant figure in my\r\nlife for the last seven years. He has always been there for me in a supportive and\r\ncaring way, helping me with school, providing for me, and offering guidance when\r\nI needed it.\r\n? He has made efforts to be involved in my life, and I have always appreciated his\r\nsupport. Although I do not consider him my \"father\" in the legal sense, I do see\r\nhim as a positive male role model and someone who has always treated me with\r\nkindness and respect.\r\n\r\n2. Observations of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag:\r\n? I have noticed that Crycella frequently speaks negatively about Todd Hill, my\r\nbiological father, in front of me. This makes me uncomfortable, as it seems like\r\nshe is trying to turn me against him. I don�t like hearing these comments, as they\r\nonly make me feel conflicted and upset.\r\n? Crycella has also discouraged me from having a positive relationship with\r\nMicheal, even though he has always treated me well. On several occasions, she\r\nhas dismissed my feelings when I express how much I appreciate Micheal�s\r\nsupport in my life.\r\n\r\n3. Disagreement and Combative Behavior:\r\n? Crycella often becomes combative when I express positive things about Micheal,\r\nwhich makes me feel like I can�t talk freely about my own experiences. If I\r\nmention that I feel comfortable with him or that he has been helpful to me, she\r\ngets upset and tries to change the subject or criticize him.\r\n\r\n? This has made it difficult for me to maintain a healthy and open relationship with\r\nMicheal. I know he has always been there for me, but Crycella�s behavior\r\ninterferes with that.\r\n\r\n4. The Role of Micheal Lawrence Salmon in My Life:\r\n? While he is not my legal father, Micheal has always been there to offer support\r\nand care. He�s made sure I had what I needed, and he has been involved in my\r\nlife when I needed him. He has helped me with schoolwork, been present for\r\nimportant events, and has always shown me kindness.\r\n? I wish I could see Micheal more often and without Crycella�s interference. He has\r\nalways tried to be a positive influence in my life, and I believe he cares for me,\r\neven though we don�t have a traditional father-daughter relationship.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nBased on my observations, Micheal has been a caring and supportive person in my life.\r\nCrycella�s behavior has often made it difficult for me to maintain a positive relationship with him,\r\nand I believe that her treatment of him has been unfair. Additionally, I feel uncomfortable with\r\nthe negative things she says about my biological father, Todd Hill, as it has created unnecessary\r\ntension. I wish that I could freely express my feelings without fear of upsetting Crycella.`

    content: `PARENTING TIME LOG\r\nDate: Thursday, December 26, 2024\r\nInteraction:\r\n? Asked Crycella when she would like to see Felix again. After three hours of arguing, she\r\nchose Saturday but refused to provide an itinerary.\r\n? Expressed concerns regarding supervision and requested a chaperone for future visits\r\ndue to a prior incident where Felix returned cold and shaking after being outside for over\r\nfour hours in inappropriate clothing. Crycella refused to agree to any supervision or\r\nprovide photos of Felix at events.\r\nDate: Friday, December 27, 2024\r\nInteraction:\r\n? Received no updates from Crycella regarding Saturday plans as promised.\r\nDate: Saturday, December 28, 2024\r\nInteraction:\r\n? 8:00 AM: Contacted Crycella to confirm her plans to see Felix. She stated she still had\r\nno specific plans and could not provide any details.\r\n? 8:30 AM: Informed Crycella she could have Felix from 3:00 PM until bedtime and\r\nexplained that if she did not show up, it would be her responsibility. She agreed to this\r\narrangement and again told me it was because of her broken car.\r\nImpact:\r\n1. Lost opportunity for personal time with friends due to last-minute planning changes.\r\n2. Missed potential side jobs, resulting in lost income opportunities critical as a single\r\nfather.\r\n3. Created unnecessary stress and uncertainty for Felix due to Crycella�s lack of reliability.\r\nConclusion\r\nCrycella�s repeated failure to provide clear plans and her reliance on transportation issues as an\r\nexcuse has significantly impacted my ability to plan my life and care for Felix. Her inconsistent\r\nvisitation and lack of accountability place undue strain on me as a single father and affect Felix�s\r\nemotional well-being.\r\n\r\nI am prepared to provide further details or testimony to support this log.`

    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Petitioner, and respectfully moves this Court for a\r\nchange of judge pursuant to Rule 51.05 of the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure. In support of\r\nthis motion, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n1.

Judge Selby has allowed knowingly false testimony from witnesses, affecting the\r\nfairness of the custody proceedings.\r\n3. Judge Selby�s failure to consider relevant evidence has led to an unjust ruling that is not\r\nin the best interest of the minor child.\r\n4. Missouri law entitles litigants to a fair and impartial judge, and Petitioner believes Judge\r\nSelby�s actions indicate an inability to render an unbiased decision.\r\n5.

In support of this Motion, Respondent states as follows:\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis Motion is brought to ensure the welfare and safety of Felix Salmon by establishing clear\r\ncommunication protocols between the parties regarding his care, health, and activities during\r\nPetitioner�s parenting time.\r\nII. Factual Basis\r\n1. Failure to Provide Necessary Information\r\n? During Felix�s recent visit with Petitioner, he returned to Respondent exhibiting\r\nsymptoms of vomiting and illness. When asked about his diet and activities,\r\nPetitioner refused to disclose any relevant information, hindering Respondent�s\r\nability to provide appropriate care and treatment.\r\n\r\n2. Ongoing Communication Issues\r\n? Petitioner has consistently refused to communicate effectively or provide timely\r\nand accurate information regarding Felix�s well-being. This includes:\r\n? Failing to notify Respondent of activities or locations during her parenting\r\ntime.\r\n? Refusing to answer questions regarding Felix�s diet, health, or exposure\r\nto unsafe environments.\r\n? Creating unnecessary stress and instability for Felix due to lack of\r\ncooperation and transparency.\r\n3. Pattern of Neglect and Poor Co-Parenting\r\n? As outlined in Respondent�s prior Motion for Supervised Visitation, Petitioner�s\r\nbehavior demonstrates a pattern of neglect and poor judgment, including:\r\n? Failing to provide adequate clothing during outings in freezing weather.\r\n? Exposing Felix to unsafe living conditions and toxic family dynamics.\r\n\r\n4. Impact on Felix�s Well-Being\r\n\r\n? The lack of communication directly impacts Felix�s health and emotional stability,\r\nas Respondent is unable to make informed decisions regarding his care when\r\nnecessary details are withheld.\r\n\r\nIII. Legal Basis\r\nMissouri law emphasizes the importance of cooperative co-parenting and prioritizing the child�s\r\nbest interests in custody and visitation matters. A communication order is essential to ensure\r\nboth parties can fulfill their parental responsibilities effectively.\r\nIV. Requested Relief\r\nWHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court:\r\n1. Order both parties to communicate promptly and effectively regarding:\r\n? Felix�s health, diet, and activities during parenting time.\r\n? Any incidents, injuries, or illnesses occurring while Felix is in the care of either\r\nparty.\r\n? Specific times and locations for pick-up and drop-off to ensure consistency.\r\n2. Require Petitioner to respond to inquiries about Felix�s care within a reasonable\r\ntimeframe (e.g., 24 hours).\r\n3. Impose penalties for non-compliance, including but not limited to:\r\n? Financial penalties for failure to communicate as ordered.\r\n? Further restrictions on parenting time if non-compliance continues.\r\n4. Grant any other relief this Court deems just and proper to protect Felix�s best interests.\r\nV. Supporting Exhibits\r\nRespondent incorporates by reference all exhibits previously submitted in the Motion for\r\nSupervised Visitation, including:\r\n? Exhibit A: Text messages and documentation regarding Petitioner�s refusal to\r\ncommunicate.\r\n? Exhibit B: Evidence of prior incidents affecting Felix�s health and well-being.`

This request is made to protect the health, safety, and well-being of Felix Salmon in\r\nlight of repeated incidents demonstrating a lack of appropriate care by Petitioner. In support of\r\nthis Motion, Respondent states as follows:\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis Motion is brought pursuant to Missouri law, which authorizes the Court to take emergency\r\nmeasures to safeguard the welfare of a minor child. The relief requested herein is necessary to\r\naddress ongoing concerns about Petitioner�s ability to provide a safe and stable environment for\r\nFelix Salmon.\r\nII. Factual Basis\r\n1. Recent Incident of Illness After Visitation\r\n? On January 7, 2025, Felix returned from visitation with Petitioner exhibiting\r\nsymptoms of vomiting and illness.\r\n? When Respondent inquired about Felix�s diet and activities during the visit,\r\nPetitioner refused to provide any information, hindering Respondent�s ability to\r\nensure appropriate medical care and determine the cause of the illness.\r\n\r\n2. History of Unsafe Practices\r\n? As outlined in Respondent�s prior Motion for Supervised Visitation, Petitioner has\r\nengaged in a pattern of neglect and poor judgment, including:\r\n?

    content: `TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE COURT:\r\nComes now Micheal Lawrence Salmon, the Plaintiff, and respectfully moves this Court to\r\nimmediately retract and modify the custody order entered on December 3, 2024 due to\r\nfraudulent testimony, procedural misconduct, and unethical legal tactics that have caused\r\nsubstantial and unjust harm. Plaintiff further requests this Court impose sanctions against\r\nDefendant Joshua Garrett for his deliberate role in misleading the Court and obstructing justice.\r\nIn support of this motion, Plaintiff states as follows:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nPlaintiff has been subjected to fraudulent testimony and unethical legal maneuvers that have\r\ndeprived him of his parental rights and inflicted significant financial and emotional harm. This\r\nmotion seeks urgent relief by requesting the immediate reversal of the unjust custody order and\r\nfinancial sanctions against Defendant Joshua Garrett for his misconduct in these proceedings.\r\nFurthermore, Plaintiff explicitly informed Judge Matt Alan Selby during the hearing that he\r\npossessed a contradictory lease agreement and supporting text messages disproving the false\r\nclaims made by Defendants. However, Judge Selby refused to review this evidence, thereby\r\nrendering a decision based on knowingly incomplete and misleading testimony.\r\n\r\nGROUNDS FOR RELIEF\r\nA. FRAUDULENT TESTIMONY AND MISREPRESENTATION OF LIVING SITUATION\r\n1. Jozef Hanratty falsely testified that Plaintiff was an unfit parent despite only knowing\r\nPlaintiff for 30 days.\r\n2. Hanratty admitted under oath to harassing Plaintiff and interfering with his custody,\r\nyet the Court still allowed his testimony to dictate custody arrangements.\r\n\r\n3. Court filings falsely described Plaintiff as \"homeless\" despite Plaintiff having a valid lease\r\nagreement and multiple stable housing options.\r\n4. Plaintiff attempted to present his lease agreement and supporting text messages to\r\nJudge Matt Alan Selby, who refused to review the documents, leading to an unfair and\r\nunfounded ruling.\r\nB. UNETHICAL CONDUCT AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE BY JOSHUA GARRETT\r\n1. Joshua Garrett knowingly presented false and misleading testimony to the Court, failing\r\nin his duty as an officer of the Court.\r\n2. Garrett conspired with Jozef Hanratty and Crycella Freitag to fabricate a crisis, leading to\r\nan emergency custody order on December 3, 2024, based on false pretenses.\r\n3. Garrett deliberately obstructed Plaintiff�s ability to respond to legal actions by refusing to\r\ncommunicate via email and relying on postal mail to delay essential court\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n4. Garrett actively pressured Plaintiff�s landlord to remove him from his residence,\r\nmanufacturing instability to be used against Plaintiff in custody proceedings.\r\nC. COORDINATED INTERFERENCE AND MALICIOUS LITIGATION\r\n1. Defendants colluded to manipulate custody proceedings through perjury and falsified\r\nclaims, directly harming Plaintiff�s parental rights.\r\n2. As a result of Defendants� fraudulent actions, Plaintiff has suffered:\r\n? Unjustified loss of custody and parental time.\r\n? Severe financial hardship, including loss of internet access essential for work\r\nand legal proceedings.\r\n? Emotional distress due to the disruption of his child�s well-being and false\r\nallegations against him.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED RELIEF\r\nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:\r\n1. Immediately vacate and modify the custody order based on the fraudulent testimony and\r\nmisrepresentation of facts.\r\n2. Grant primary custody to Plaintiff, as it is in the best interest of the child and necessary\r\nto rectify the injustice caused by Defendants� fraudulent conduct.\r\n3. Conduct a new custody evaluation or hearing to properly assess the current\r\ncircumstances, ensuring a fair and unbiased review.\r\n4. Impose financial sanctions on Joshua Garrett for his unethical conduct and deliberate\r\ninterference in Plaintiff�s custody rights.\r\n5. Order Crycella Freitag and Joshua Garrett to reimburse Plaintiff for legal expenses and\r\nfinancial damages incurred due to their fraudulent actions.\r\n\r\n6. Disqualify Joshua Garrett from further representing Crycella Freitag due to his pattern of\r\nunethical behavior.\r\n7. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.`

    status: "Pending",
    content: `To Whom It May Concern,\r\nI am submitting this formal complaint against Elizabeth Lacy, Domestic Clerk of the Stone\r\nCounty Circuit Court, regarding her deliberate obstruction of my appeal process in case\r\n24SN-DR00104. The actions taken by Ms. Lacy violate Missouri Supreme Court Rule 81.12,\r\nimpede my due process rights, and create an unlawful financial barrier to my ability to appeal.\r\nSpecific Allegations of Misconduct\r\n1. Misrepresentation of Appellate Record Requirements\r\nMissouri Rule 81.12(a) and (c) states that an appellant may submit a statement of evidence in\r\nlieu of a full transcript when the cost is prohibitive. However, Ms. Lacy falsely stated that I am\r\nrequired to pay for the entire transcript and cannot submit a partial record. This is a blatant\r\nmisrepresentation of the rule and an attempt to obstruct my access to the appeals process.\r\n2. Financially Obstructing My Right to Appeal\r\nMs. Lacy has created an artificial financial barrier to my appeal by:\r\n? Falsely stating that I must pay for a full transcript at an inflated rate ($3.50 per page,\r\ntotaling over $1,000) despite the availability of alternative means under Rule 81.12(c).\r\n? Demanding an uncertain \"deposit\" without disclosing how final costs are determined,\r\nmaking it impossible to budget or plan for the appeal.\r\n? Withholding information on cost waivers and alternative documentation that could allow\r\nme to proceed without an excessive financial burden.\r\nThese actions directly contradict Missouri�s established appellate procedures and constitute an\r\nabuse of administrative discretion.\r\n3. Improper Handling of My Appeal Filing\r\n? Ms. Lacy has delayed and obstructed my appeal by failing to promptly process my\r\nNotice of Appeal and attaching unnecessary financial conditions before forwarding my\r\ncase to the Missouri Court of Appeals.\r\n? She has refused to provide clear guidance on the accepted means of payment for the\r\nappeal filing fee, further delaying my ability to move forward.\r\n4. Acting Outside the Scope of Her Duties\r\nThe role of a clerk is ministerial�meaning clerks must process filings according to procedural\r\nrules without imposing additional conditions that are not required by law. Ms. Lacy is\r\n\r\nimproperly inserting herself into judicial decision-making by wrongfully interpreting appellate\r\nrules and creating conditions that prevent me from filing in a fair and timely manner.\r\nRequested Actions & Remedies\r\nGiven the above violations, I request the following:\r\n1. A formal investigation into Ms. Lacy�s conduct, including a review of whether she\r\nhas similarly obstructed other pro se litigants.\r\n2. Immediate processing of my Notice of Appeal without unlawful financial barriers.\r\n3. Clarification on the use of a Statement of Evidence in lieu of a transcript, per Rule\r\n81.12(c), to ensure compliance with appellate procedures.\r\n4. Disciplinary action against Ms. Lacy for administrative misconduct if it is found that\r\nshe has intentionally misrepresented legal requirements.\r\nFailure to address this misconduct will leave me with no choice but to escalate this matter to\r\nhigher judicial oversight bodies, including the Missouri Commission on Retirement,\r\nRemoval, and Discipline of Judges, and to pursue legal remedies to enforce my right to due\r\nprocess.\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request a written response detailing the\r\nsteps being taken to address these concerns.`

    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Salmon, Petitioner, and submits the following evidence and motion to formally tie Kelly Truelove to the present case, document procedural manipulation, and highlight judicial oversight regarding perjury committed by Jozef Hanratty and Attorney Joshua Garrett. In support of this motion, Petitioner states as follows: 1. Evidence Submission: Notice to Pay or Quit from Kelly Truelove ● Petitioner received a "Notice to Pay or Quit for Non-Payment of Rent" from Kelly's legal counsel. ● This notice is the first form of communication received from her, despite Petitioner's multiple attempts to arrange payment, which have been systematically obstructed. ● The notice states that April will be the final month of tenancy but fails to specify the exact amount owed, demonstrating bad-faith intent rather than an attempt to resolve the matter. ● The notice also declares that legal action will begin on April 1st, aligning with Petitioner's preparation to file in Kansas, where proper jurisdiction exists. 2. Procedural Manipulation and Inclusion of Kelly Truelove ● Kelly Truelove has intentionally delayed communications and manipulated circumstances to gain an unfair advantage in litigation. ● Given that housing and financial stability are directly relevant to this custody case, her involvement is critical and should be officially acknowledged by the court. ● The court should note her role in strategically delaying payments and controlling financial leverage to influence ongoing legal proceedings unfairly.  3. Judicial Error & Perjury by Jozef Hanratty and Joshua Garrett ● Jozef Hanratty provided knowingly false testimony, which has been acknowledged as false by the court but was still used to justify an unfavorable temporary order. ● Attorney Joshua Garrett has facilitated this perjury and has misrepresented facts before the court. ● The judge’s failure to act on this perjury while continuing to enforce orders based on knowingly false testimony constitutes a clear legal oversight and miscarriage of justice. ● Petitioner requests that the court formally address these infractions and reconsider rulings that have been improperly influenced by false testimony. 4. Relief Requested Petitioner respectfully requests the following actions be taken: 1. Formally include Kelly Truelove as a relevant party to this case, given her demonstrated impact on Petitioner's financial stability and living situation. 2. Acknowledge and rectify the judicial oversight that has allowed perjury by Jozef Hanratty and misrepresentation by Joshua Garrett to affect prior rulings. 3. Reevaluate all temporary custody orders that were based on false statements and manipulated evidence. 4. Allow Petitioner to submit all relevant financial records and prior communication attempts as evidence of Kelly Truelove’s manipulative tactics in this case.`

    date: "2025-18-2",
    type: "Petition",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a Writ of Mandamus directing the Honorable MATT ALAN SELBY, Circuit Judge of Stone County, Missouri, to:\r\nPerform his mandatory duty to rule on pending motions and address legal errors;\r\nVacate all orders issued under improper jurisdiction;\r\nTransfer this matter to the appropriate Kansas court under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA); and\r\nRestore Petitioner�s parental rights and enforce proper visitation with his son, Felix Salmon.\r\nIn support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis case presents a clear failure by the Stone County Circuit Court to perform its mandatory duties under the law. The presiding judge has:\r\nFailed to rule on multiple motions filed by Petitioner, including motions to dismiss for improper venue and motions to transfer jurisdiction under the UCCJEA; It is well-established that a trial court has a non-discretionary duty to rule on properly filed motions. See State ex rel. Jones v. McGhee, 639 S.W.2d 60 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982) (holding that a judge must rule on pending motions within a reasonable time). Failure to do so constitutes a denial of due process, warranting mandamus relief.\r\nMaintained jurisdiction over this case despite clear evidence that Stone County, Missouri, lacks jurisdiction;\r\nAllowed the Real Party in Interest, Crycella Freitag, to repeatedly violate court-ordered visitation and alienate Petitioner from his son;\r\nAllowed procedural misconduct that has placed Petitioner at a severe disadvantage, effectively denying him due process.\r\nThis Court must intervene to correct these injustices and ensure that legal procedures are followed.\r\nII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\r\nA. Improper Jurisdiction and Venue\r\nFelix Salmon resided in Stone County, Missouri, for less than six months (May 17, 2024 � November 13, 2024). Under RSMo � 452.700 and K.S.A. 23-37,201, jurisdiction vests in the state where the child has resided for six consecutive months immediately preceding the commencement of the action. Felix did not meet this threshold in Stone County. Wyandotte County is the only legitimate claim to jurisdiction, rendering the orders of the Stone County Circuit Court void ab initio.\r\nPursuant to the UCCJEA (RSMo � 452.700 et seq.), jurisdiction is proper only where the child has lived for six consecutive months prior to legal action.\r\nBoth parents currently reside in Kansas, making Kansas the appropriate forum for this case under the UCCJEA.\r\nCrycella Freitag engaged in jurisdictional manipulation by delaying separation and creating a temporary residence in Stone County Missouri to fabricate a legal basis for venue.\r\nB. Judge�s Failure to Address Motions\r\nPetitioner has filed multiple motions, including:\r\nMotion to Dismiss for Improper Venue;\r\nMotion to Transfer Jurisdiction to Kansas;\r\nMotion to Enforce Visitation;\r\nMotion for Protection of Minor Witness from Undue Influence (For my daughter Anya, whom I have raised for seven years and have not seen for three months);\r\nMotion for Emergency Relief (Documented three instances where Crycella has been unsafe with Felix, addressing direct concerns regarding his safety);\r\nMotion for Communication Order (Petitioner had to disclose all information in interrogatories, whereas Crycella was able to withhold critical information, including her financial obligations and residency);\r\nMotion to Sanction Petitioner and Petitioner�s Counsel for Unethical and Obstructive Conduct (Addressing misconduct by Mr. Garrett);\r\nMotion to Issue Subpoena for Minor Witness Testimony (Attempted to obtain testimony from Anya before further manipulation by Crycella);\r\nMotion for Home Inspection and Financial Disclosure (Petitioner has been denied any information regarding Felix's living conditions, has not been allowed to inspect his sleeping arrangements, and has been left without knowledge while Crycella retains access to Petitioner�s home).\r\nThe judge has failed to rule on these motions, leaving Petitioner without recourse and violating his right to due process. The United States Supreme Court has long held that 'The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.' Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). The failure to rule on pending motions deprives Petitioner of this right, necessitating intervention from this Court.\r\nC. Denial of Visitation and Parental Rights\r\nThe judge granted Petitioner only up to two hours of supervised visitation on Saturdays up to Crycella�s discretion.\r\nCrycella Freitag has repeatedly denied visitation in violation of court orders.\r\nFelix is currently living in a household with eight people and 14 animals, raising concerns about his well-being and stability.\r\nCrycella Freitag has refused to allow Petitioner�s family and friends access to Felix, further alienating him from his support network.\r\nD. Intentional Financial Hardship Created by Crycella Freitag\r\nCrycella Freitag has failed to contribute financially to Felix�s care.\r\nShe has engaged in legal maneuvers intended to drain Petitioner�s financial resources, forcing him to proceed pro se.\r\nThe court's failure to address these issues has compounded the prejudice against Petitioner.\r\nIII. LEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nA. Failure to Perform Mandatory Duties\r\nA trial court has a mandatory duty to rule on properly filed motions. The failure to do so deprives Petitioner of his constitutional right to due process.\r\nB. Violation of the UCCJEA\r\nThe UCCJEA (RSMo � 452.700 et seq.) mandates that jurisdiction is proper where the child has lived for six consecutive months. Felix has not met this threshold in Missouri, making the continued assertion of jurisdiction by Stone County a clear legal error.\r\nC. Clear Abuse of Discretion\r\nThe judge's refusal to transfer jurisdiction despite the clear mandates of the UCCJEA constitutes an abuse of discretion.\r\nD. No Adequate Remedy at Law\r\nPetitioner has exhausted all available legal remedies, filing multiple motions that remain unanswered. The lack of court action leaves Petitioner with no adequate legal remedy other than this writ.\r\nIV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nIssue a Writ of Mandamus directing the Honorable MATT ALAN SELBY to:\r\na) Rule on all pending motions within 14 days;\r\nb) Vacate all orders issued in excess of jurisdiction; and\r\nc) Transfer this matter to Kansas in accordance with the UCCJEA.\r\nRestore Petitioner�s parental rights and enforce meaningful visitation with Felix Salmon.\r\nStay enforcement of any orders granting sole custody to Crycella Freitag pending resolution of this writ.\r\nGrant Petitioner�s request for a fee waiver (see below).\r\nCivil Rights Violations under 42 U.S.C. � 1983\r\nJudge Selby's deliberate failure to rule on motions and enforce parental rights\r\nConstitutional violations of due process\r\nDeprivation of parental rights under color of law These violations can yield significant damages, including punitive damages against state actors\r\nTort Claims Against Opposing Party\r\nIntentional infliction of emotional distress\r\nFraudulent misrepresentation to establish jurisdiction\r\nParental alienation \r\nBad faith litigation\r\nAll therapy/counseling costs related to separation from Felix\r\nRealized Damages Documentation (will be provided)\r\nLost wages from improper venue\r\nTravel expenses\r\nLegal costs\r\nLost business opportunities\r\nProperty access denial\r\nHealthcare access denial\r\nInterference with Parent-Child Relationship\r\nEvery denied visitation with monetary value\r\nImpact on Felix's relationship with siblings\r\nLoss of parental companionship\r\nEducational decision-making interference\r\nV. REQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests a fee waiver for the filing of this petition. Petitioner is currently experiencing financial hardship and lacks the resources to pay the filing fee. A fee waiver is necessary to ensure access to justice.\r\nVI. CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court grant the Writ of Mandamus and provide the relief requested.`

    content: `I, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, being duly sworn, state as follows:\r\nIntroduction\r\nI am the Respondent/Counter-Petitioner in the above-captioned matter.\r\nResidency of Felix Salmon\r\nFelix Salmon resided in Stone County, Missouri, for less than six months�from May 17, 2024, to November 13, 2024.\r\nLack of Significant Connection to Stone County\r\nAt the time this case was filed, neither parent had any significant connection to Stone County. Neither I nor Crycella Freitag have any meaningful ties to Stone County. We have no family, no friends, and no community connections in the area. The fact that our witnesses had to drive over four hours to attend court proceedings further demonstrates the lack of any substantial connection to the jurisdiction.\r\nDeceptive Statements by Petitioner\r\nThe only reason Felix remained in Stone County beyond what was necessary was due to deceptive statements made by Petitioner/Counter-Respondent, Crycella Freitag.\r\nExhibit I: Text Messages\r\nAttached as Exhibit I are text messages from Crycella Freitag, in which she:\r\nEncouraged me to remain in Branson, despite having no intention of living with me.\r\nGave false assurances about our cohabitation, despite admitting in court that she had lost romantic interest and moved out permanently.\r\nDeliberately attempted to influence my residency to create a false claim to Stone County as a proper venue.\r\nThese messages demonstrate that Petitioner/Counter-Respondent and her legal counsel manipulated the legal process in bad faith to establish an improper venue.\r\nCurrent Residency and Jurisdiction\r\nBoth parties now reside in Kansas. Missouri no longer has a continuing jurisdictional basis under the UCCJEA. Even if Missouri originally had jurisdiction, Stone County was an improper venue due to fraud and misrepresentation.\r\nUnfair Treatment by the Court\r\nThroughout these proceedings, the court has treated me unfairly in the following ways:\r\nPerjury by Petitioner: The court has ignored clear evidence of perjury by Crycella Freitag, and her witness Jozef Hanratty including her false statements about her intentions to cohabitate, housing instability, and her deliberate misrepresentation of facts to establish jurisdiction in Stone County.\r\nIgnoring Motions: The judge has consistently ignored or denied all motions filed by me, including motions to dismiss for improper venue and motions to transfer jurisdiction to Kansas.\r\nArbitrary Civil Arguments: The judge has allowed arbitrary civil arguments that are irrelevant to the custody determination, including arguments about my residency and financial status, which have no bearing on the best interests of Felix.\r\nBias and Prejudice: The judge has demonstrated bias and prejudice by consistently ruling in favor of the Petitioner without proper consideration of the evidence or the law.\r\nFailure to Address Fraud: The court has failed to address the fraud and misrepresentation committed by the Petitioner, which has resulted in an improper venue and a miscarriage of justice.\r\nDenial of Visitation: The judge�s order granting me only two hours of visitation on Saturdays was already excessively restrictive and not in the best interests of Felix. However, Crycella Freitag has denied even this limited visitation, further alienating me from my child.\r\nIsolation from Family and Friends: Crycella Freitag has also refused to allow my friends and family to see Felix, effectively isolating him from his extended support network. This is not only unfair to me but also detrimental to Felix�s well-being and emotional development.\r\nRequest for Relief\r\nThis Court must vacate all orders and transfer this matter to the appropriate Kansas court.\r\n\r\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\r\n\r\nExhibit I Link: https://tinyurl.com/yt268ns3`

    content: `MOTION TO OBJECT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION BY RESPONDENT'S SELECTED PSYCHOLOGIST AND TO REASSERT OBJECTIONS TO PRIOR UNADDRESSED ISSUES\r\nCOMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to reject the\r\npsychological evaluation to be conducted by Susan K Vandeusen, who has been selected by\r\nRespondent, and to instead appoint a neutral, court-approved evaluator. Additionally, Petitioner\r\nseeks to formally reassert prior objections which have been ignored in these proceedings. In\r\nsupport thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n\r\nI. OBJECTION TO RESPONDENT'S SELECTED\r\nPSYCHOLOGIST\r\n1. The Evaluator Lacks Neutrality and Presents a Conflict of Interest\r\n1. The appointed psychologist, Susan K Vandeusen, was personally selected by\r\nRespondent, rather than being a neutral evaluator appointed by the Court.\r\n2. It is in the best interest of the child, Felix Salmon, that any psychological evaluation be\r\nconducted by a neutral, court-appointed forensic psychologist, rather than a\r\nprofessional with a potential bias toward one parent.\r\n3. Susan K Vandeusen has no verifiable history of conducting forensic custody\r\nevaluations and lacks publicly available records or professional reviews, raising\r\nconcerns about their credibility.\r\n1\r\n\r\n2. The Appointment of a Neutral Evaluator Ensures Fairness\r\n4. Petitioner respectfully requests that, should a psychological evaluation be deemed\r\nnecessary, the Court appoint a licensed, neutral forensic psychologist with a proven\r\nrecord of unbiased custody evaluations.\r\n5. A neutral evaluator ensures fairness and prevents undue influence from either party in the\r\ncustody proceedings.\r\n3. Due Process and Fair Treatment\r\n6. The appointment of a neutral forensic evaluator is consistent with the principles of due\r\nprocess and fairness in family court proceedings.\r\n7. The Court has a duty to ensure that both parties are treated equally in any\r\npsychological evaluations that may impact custody determinations.\r\n\r\nII. REASSERTION OF PRIOR OBJECTIONS\r\n4. Unaddressed Objections Demonstrating Systemic Bias\r\n8. Petitioner has previously filed motions and objections regarding:\r\n? The unilateral acceptance of Respondent�s requests while Petitioner�s filings\r\nare ignored.\r\n? The failure to acknowledge Petitioner�s evidence regarding financial support,\r\nFelix�s residency history, and the Respondent�s lack of financial contribution.\r\n? The denial of Petitioner�s ability to conduct discovery, including the\r\nopportunity to submit interrogatories and obtain key financial and medical\r\nrecords.\r\n? The failure to address the jurisdictional argument that Felix has resided in\r\nWyandotte County for the majority of his life, making this the proper venue.\r\n? The lack of enforcement against Respondent�s repeated refusals to provide\r\nfinancial support, while Petitioner has been solely responsible for childcare and\r\nliving expenses.\r\n5. Pattern of Procedural Imbalance\r\n9. The Court�s pattern of denying or ignoring Petitioner�s motions while granting\r\nRespondent�s requests is creating an unfair procedural imbalance.\r\n10. The failure to consider evidence, grant basic discovery rights, and apply equal\r\nstandards raises serious concerns about judicial impartiality.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\n1. Reject the evaluation by Susan K Vandeusen due to the potential conflict of interest.\r\n2. Appoint a neutral, court-approved forensic psychologist to conduct any required\r\nevaluations.\r\n3. Address and rule on Petitioner�s prior objections, which have been repeatedly\r\nignored.\r\n4. Ensure equal consideration of both parties' filings and motions.\r\n5. Grant any further relief this Court deems just and proper.`

    date: "2025-27-2",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST MR. GARRETT\r\nArgument:\r\nMr. Garrett has engaged in legal malpractice, bad faith litigation tactics, and knowingly\r\npresented false claims. His actions have caused unnecessary delays, misled the Court, and\r\ncaused significant harm to the Plaintiff.\r\nEvidence:\r\n1. Contradictions and Misrepresentations:\r\n? Crycella�s statements regarding sole custody directly contradict her prior\r\nadmissions and actions.\r\n? Crycella edited video evidence to misrepresent the Plaintiff�s statements, which\r\nshe later admitted to possessing in full.\r\n? Crycella falsely claimed the Plaintiff was homeless while actively participating in\r\nhousing searches with him.\r\n\r\n2. Unethical Actions:\r\n? Crycella falsely accused the Plaintiff of kicking her out in July, despite evidence\r\nshowing she left voluntarily and took only half her belongings.\r\n\r\n? Jozef made false claims about the Plaintiff�s eviction status, which were directly\r\ncontradicted by the lack of proper notice and the Judge�s own acknowledgment.\r\n? Jozef�s allegations of bullying and non-payment of rent are undermined by his\r\nown actions, including unplugging the Plaintiff�s internet, destroying food, and\r\nturning off the heat.\r\n\r\nRequested Relief:\r\n? Strike all false and misleading statements from the record.\r\n? Impose sanctions on Mr. Garrett for his unethical conduct and bad faith litigation tactics.\r\n? Award the Plaintiff reasonable attorney�s fees and costs incurred as a result of these\r\nactions.`

    date: "2025-3-3",
    type: "Objection",
    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `OBJECTION TO THE QUALIFIED PROTECTIVE ORDER\r\nCounter-Petitioner respectfully objects to the Qualified Protective Order. While we acknowledge the importance of protecting sensitive psychological information, the proposed order risks overcomplicating the process and diverting focus from the best interests of the child.\r\n\r\nAs Patterson v. Chicago, 141 F.3d 831, 836 (7th Cir. 1998) emphasizes simplicity and fairness in court proceedings; we request that the Court deny the motion to the extent it creates unnecessary complexity. Delays and procedural burdens would only exacerbate the harm caused by the opposing party�s actions and undermine the integrity of these proceedings.\r\nOFFER OF PROOF\r\n1. Motion to Review Racial Bias\r\nThe Honorable Judge Matt Alan Selby, court clerks, Josh Garrett, and Crycella Freitag(and family) have demonstrated a pattern of unfair treatment and racial bias against the Counter-Petitioner Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).  Formal reports detailing these incidents have been filed and are on record with the court. Specifically:\r\nThe presiding judge has made rulings that demonstrate a clear bias against the Counter-Petitioner, ignoring or discounting (17) articles of submitted valid evidence and arguments presented by the Counter-Petitioner.\r\nCourt clerks have engaged in recorded discriminatory behavior as Jurisdictional Overreach & Procedural Violations to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 81.12.\r\nThe Court�s failure to review the evidence allowed perjury to persist on multiple occasions, even after the Counter-Petitioner submitted clear proof to all parties. This disregard for the truth has created a hostile environment and severely prejudiced Counter-Petitioner�s right to a fair hearing.\r\nThese actions violate Due Process Clause outlined in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 3.3 (Candor Toward the Tribunal) and Rule 8.4 (Misconduct) Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009).\r\nRequested Relief:\r\nThe Court refers this matter to the appropriate state bar association for disciplinary review, given The Honorable Judge Matt Alan Selby, court clerks, Josh Garrett, and Crycella Freitag(and family) willful violations of legal and ethical standards.`

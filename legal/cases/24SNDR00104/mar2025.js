    status: "Pending",
    content: `Motion for Sanctions Against Mr. Garrett and Crycella Freitag\r\n(Re-filing motion to preserve the issue for appeal) Counter-Petitioner respectfully objects to the Court�s ruling on temporary custody order. Mr. Garrett and Crycella Freitag have repeatedly engaged in bad faith litigation tactics, including perjury, obstruction of justice, and racial bias, despite being warned of the consequences. His actions have caused significant financial, emotional, and psychological harm to Counter-Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and have directly interfered with Micheal�s ability to maintain a relationship with his son, Felix. Specifically:\r\nPerjury and False Testimony: Mr. Garrett called witnesses who knowingly committed perjury, including Crycella, who made false statements under oath (e.g., �Micheal is unstable,� �I�m scared of him,� �Micheal yells at the Judge�). These claims are contradicted by video evidence.\r\nObstruction of Justice: Mr. Garrett coached Crycella in emotional manipulation, as evidenced by his repeated statements such as, �Watch his reaction.� He knowingly allowed this abuse of process to continue for weeks.\r\nUnfair Custody Arrangement: Mr. Garrett requested a biased and unfair custody arrangement that was not in the best interest of Felix and was based on false and inflammatory statements.\r\nWeaponization of the Legal System: Crycella repeatedly made false allegations to law enforcement and the court, including claims that Micheal is �unsafe� or �needs mental help,� without providing any evidence.\r\nRacial Bias: The court's conduct demonstrates a pattern of racial bias, as they consistently undermined the credibility and evidence presented by the Black parent, while giving undue weight to the claims of the white parties involved.\r\nCase Law:\r\nChambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991): Courts have inherent authority to impose sanctions for bad-faith conduct, including abusive litigation tactics.\r\nRoadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752 (1980): Courts can sanction attorneys and parties for misconduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.\r\nShepherd v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 62 F.3d 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1995): Sanctions are appropriate for deliberate deception or obstruction of justice.\r\n\r\nRequested Relief:\r\nLost Work and Time: Award Counter-Petitioner $10,000 for lost work and time directly resulting from the biased and bad-faith litigation tactics employed by the opposing party.\r\nDebt Owed:\r\nOrder the immediate payment of the full $90,000 debt owed to Counter-Petitioner, with complete financial transparency to ensure compliance.\r\nCompensatory Sanctions Against Josh Garrett:\r\nImpose sanctions on Josh Garrett in the amount of $60,000 to compensate Micheal Lawrence Salmon for the following:\r\nFinancial Losses: On January 30th, Micheal explicitly warned Mr. Garrett to cease his misconduct and review the evidence, citing $30,000 in damages at that time. Despite this warning, Mr. Garrett doubled down on his bad faith conduct by knowingly presenting false testimony, including the claim that Kelly Truelove verified Jozef Hanratty�s narrative, which is contradicted by the evidence.\r\nRelationship Damages: Mr. Garrett�s actions have directly interfered with Micheal�s ability to maintain a relationship with his son, Felix, causing irreparable harm and to his family who are following this case.\r\nEmotional Distress: Micheal has endured severe emotional and psychological harm as a result of Mr. Garrett�s misconduct, including the perpetuation of false claims and perjury.\r\nThe Court compels the disclosure of all communications between Mr. Garrett, Crycella Freitag, Amanda Freitag (and husband), Kelly Truelove, Stephanie Reed, Tyler Brown, Micheal�s family, and Jozef Hanratty regarding efforts to misrepresent evidence.\r\nThe Court considers the impact of Mr. Garrett�s fraudulent claims on prior rulings, including the temporary custody order, and takes corrective action to rectify any decisions influenced by falsified evidence and strike all false claims submitted as fact.`

    content: `Motion to Refer for Criminal Investigation\r\nReason: (Re-filing motion to preserve the issue for appeal) The actions of Crycella Freitag and Mr. Garrett meet the legal definitions of neglect, abuse, and conspiracy, including:\r\nPerjury: Crycella and Mr. Garrett knowingly presented false testimony to the court.\r\nObstruction of Justice: They withheld evidence (e.g., the beginning of audio recordings, Josh and Kelly�s conversation transcript, Crycella�s financials, and text transcripts with Jozef, Amanda, Stephanie, Josh, and Petitioner�s family), edited recordings, and refused to comply with court orders.\r\nAbuse of Process: Crycella weaponized law enforcement and made false allegations to gain an unfair advantage in custody proceedings. She also ignored court orders and alienated Felix from a capable and loving parent.\r\nConspiracy: Mr. Garrett and Crycella conspired to manipulate the legal system, including coaching witnesses and submitting false evidence.\r\nCase Law:\r\nState v. Smith, 456 S.W.3d 849 (Mo. 2015): Courts have the authority to refer matters for criminal investigation when there is evidence of abuse, neglect, or conspiracy.\r\nUnited States v.

    content: `Petition for Sole Custody\r\n(Re-filing motion to preserve the issue for appeal) Counter-Petitioner respectfully objects to all Crycella�s motions for custody. Crycella has consistently acted in bad faith, including committing perjury, violating court orders, and intentionally separating Counter-Petitioner from Felix. She has also abused the legal process by weaponizing law enforcement, and threatening to do it again. Her actions demonstrate a pattern of behavior that is harmful to Felix�s well-being and undermines Micheal�s ability to act as a responsible parent. The Counter-Petitioner has demonstrated fairness and good co-parenting techniques.\r\nMissouri Revised Statutes � 452.375: Custody decisions must be based on the best interests of the child, including the willingness of each parent to facilitate a relationship between the child and the other parent.\r\nRequested Relief:\r\nGrant Counter-Petitioner (Micheal Salmon) sole legal and physical custody of Felix.\r\nOrder that any visitation granted to Crycella Freitag be supervised (to be decided by Micheal), due to her demonstrated inability to act in Felix�s best interests.\r\nVisitation schedule: Micheal has recommended up to 10 hours monthly (tracked via google calendar which is 2 hours more than what the court gave Micheal).\r\nSet child support obligations at $500 per month, based on Crycella's lack of financial contributions and Micheal�s sole financial responsibility for Felix�s care.`

Breach of Contract: As a 51% owner of Brambletwist LLC, Crycella has failed to fulfill her contractual obligations to disclose financials related to business operations and revenue.\r\nRequested Relief:\r\nThe Court orders Crycella to produce complete financial disclosures within seven (7) days, including but not limited to:\r\nAll bank account statements (personal and business) from the last three years.\r\nTax returns for the last three years. Pay stubs and proof of income from any source.

    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `The presiding judge has ruled against Counter-Petitioner multiple times despite clear evidence of perjury, obstruction, and misconduct by opposing counsel and related parties. A pattern of rulings suggests a lack of impartiality, requiring judicial review to ensure that future decisions are based solely on facts and law. The court has previously ignored or dismissed substantial evidence that directly contradicts claims made by Crycella Freitag and her legal team. The judge has failed to enforce accountability against those who have lied under oath, creating a prejudicial environment against Counter-Petitioner. Furthermore, given the pattern of adverse rulings and the clear appearance of judicial bias, Counter-Petitioner respectfully requests certification under Rule 51 for an immediate interlocutory appeal on the question of judicial bias. Waiting for a final judgment would cause undue prejudice to Counter-Petitioner and Felix, as the ongoing bias undermines the integrity of these proceedings and jeopardizes Felix�s best interests.\r\nDue Process Clause � U.S. Constitution (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments): Every litigant is entitled to an impartial tribunal.\r\nCaperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009): When judicial bias is apparent or reasonably questioned, due process demands review.\r\nMissouri Supreme Court Rule 2-2.11: Judges must recuse themselves when their impartiality can reasonably be questioned.\r\nRequested Relief:\r\nThe Court implements additional oversight, such as requiring written justifications for any rulings contrary to presented evidence.\r\nThe Court ensures that all evidence submitted in previous motions is properly reviewed before any further rulings and mandates an independent review of this case by an oversight panel to determine if prior rulings were improperly influenced.\r\nCertification for Interlocutory Appeal: The Court certifies the question of judicial bias for immediate interlocutory appeal under Rule 51, as the issue presents a substantial legal question and delaying review would cause irreparable harm to Counter-Petitioner and Felix.\r\nConclusion\r\nCounter-Petitioner Micheal Lawrence Salmon respectfully moves for the Court to grant the above motions in their entirety, ensuring that Felix�s best interests are protected and that justice is served. The opposing party�s misconduct, including perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of process, warrants immediate and decisive action to safeguard Felix�s well-being and the integrity of these proceedings. Counter-Petitioner seeks a final resolution that fully and permanently dismisses all claims, motions, and allegations brought by Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, while granting all requested relief to Micheal Lawrence Salmon.\r\n\r\nEvidence WebApp: https://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html`

    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and files this Emergency Motion to enforce and protect his rights as a father to communicate with and parent his child, Felix Salmon, without undue interference from the Respondent, Crycella Freitag. Petitioner further requests an immediate hearing due to the urgent nature of this matter. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION AND EMERGENCY BASIS FOR HEARING\r\nPetitioner is the father of Felix Salmon, and the current custody arrangement, as ordered by this Court, is being weaponized by Respondent to intentionally destroy Petitioner�s relationship with his son.\r\nRespondent has repeatedly and willfully interfered with Petitioner�s court-ordered parenting time and communication with Felix, including but not limited to:\r\na. Hanging up on scheduled calls between Petitioner and Felix;\r\nb. Interrupting conversations, talking over Petitioner, and making false claims about the appropriateness of discussions;\r\nc. Setting financial barriers to prevent Petitioner from exercising his parenting time;\r\nd. Submitting edited video evidence and committing perjury to mislead the Court.\r\nRespondent�s actions are causing immediate and irreparable harm to Felix�s emotional well-being and his relationship with Petitioner. This behavior is intentional, malicious, and in direct violation of this Court�s orders and the best interests of the child.\r\nDespite Petitioner�s repeated attempts to address these issues, the Court has failed to take meaningful action, allowing Respondent to continue her harmful behavior unchecked.\r\nThis matter constitutes an emergency as it involves the immediate welfare of a child and the ongoing violation of Petitioner�s parental rights.\r\n\r\nII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nGrant an Emergency Hearing to address this matter immediately due to the urgent nature of the harm being caused to Felix and Petitioner�s relationship.\r\nOrder Respondent to Cease All Interference with Petitioner�s court-ordered parenting time and communication with Felix, including:\r\na. Prohibiting Respondent from hanging up on calls or interrupting conversations;\r\nb. Requiring Respondent to remain silent during Petitioner�s scheduled calls with Felix;\r\nc. Removing financial barriers that prevent Petitioner from exercising his parenting time.\r\nAddress Respondent�s Misconduct by:\r\na. Investigating Respondent�s submission of edited video evidence and perjury;\r\nb. Imposing sanctions or other appropriate remedies for Respondent�s willful violations of court orders.\r\nModify the Custody Arrangement to ensure that Felix�s best interests are protected and that Petitioner�s rights as a father are upheld.\r\n\r\nIII. NOTICE OF HEARING\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court schedule an Emergency Hearing at the earliest possible date. If the Court denies the request for an emergency hearing, Petitioner requests that this matter be heard on April 4, 2024, as a backup date.\r\n\r\nIV. CONCLUSION\r\nPetitioner is being systematically denied his right to parent his son, Felix, due to Respondent�s intentional and malicious actions. This Court�s intervention is urgently needed to protect Felix�s well-being and ensure that Petitioner�s parental rights are upheld.\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court grant the relief outlined above and take any additional actions necessary to address this emergency situation.\r\n\r\nEvidence WebApp: https://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html`

The Petitioner has attempted to comply with the Court�s directives regarding witness testimony; however, due to the Court�s refusal to transfer this case to the appropriate jurisdiction, Petitioner�s witnesses remain unable to travel the 8-hour distance required to testify in person.\r\nThis motion serves as a direct response to the Court�s failure to acknowledge four previous requests for a jurisdictional transfer and its ongoing dismissal of available digital evidence that eliminates the necessity of in-person witness travel.\r\n\r\nTo review the evidence, navigate to the Crycella tab on the provided web platform. Click on the Open Folder button, then open the Videos folder. Within these recordings, the Court will observe direct proof that Petitioner is not even permitted to sing a nursery rhyme to his child without Crycella�s emotional instability leading to an abrupt disconnection, demonstrating a pattern of bad-faith parenting and obstruction of court-ordered parenting time.\r\nAdditionally, despite the Court�s directive to discuss financial barriers to the Layne Project with Mr. Garrett, Petitioner�s attempts at communication have been ignored entirely. Furthermore, when Petitioner sought clarification from Crycella, she explicitly stated her refusal to consider any alternative supervised visitation centers, despite multiple good-faith proposals. This demonstrates a deliberate effort to manufacture financial and logistical barriers to prevent Petitioner from exercising his parenting rights.\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner moves this Court to:\r\nAcknowledge the availability and accessibility of all evidence and witness statements at the provided webapp link.\r\nConfirm on record whether the Court has reviewed the evidence or state explicitly its refusal to do so.\r\nClarify why digital evidence submitted in a structured, accessible manner is being ignored despite the Court�s previous instruction to provide witness testimony.\r\nReconsider its previous denials of jurisdictional transfer in light of the logistical and procedural barriers imposed on Petitioner.\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence WebApp: https://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html`

    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for an order:\r\nCompelling Respondent, Crycella Freitag, to testify under oath regarding her claims of fear and her conduct in this matter;\r\nHolding Respondent in contempt for willful misrepresentation, perjury, and parental interference; and\r\nGranting remedial relief to restore Petitioner�s parental rights and address the harm caused by Respondent�s actions.\r\nIn support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n\r\nI. INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent�s Claims of Fear Are Fabricated and Contradict Her Own Testimony\r\nRespondent has repeatedly claimed she is �scared� of Petitioner to justify withholding the minor child, Felix, from him. However, in court proceedings, Respondent has never testified under oath that she is afraid of Petitioner or that he has done anything to warrant such fear.\r\nThis inconsistency demonstrates that Respondent�s claims are a deliberate fabrication designed to manipulate the Court and alienate Petitioner from his child.\r\nRespondent�s Collusion with Third Parties to Fabricate an Unstable Living Situation\r\nOn December 4, 2024, Respondent conspired with Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove to fabricate an �unstable living situation� for Petitioner.\r\nJozef Hanratty, Petitioner�s former landlord, rescinded his position and directed Petitioner to Kelly Truelove, who then refused all communication.\r\nRespondent facilitated this collusion by refusing to intervene, despite being fully aware of the circumstances.\r\nThis fabricated instability was used to secure a temporary custody order on January 28, 2025, which Respondent now leverages to deny Petitioner access to Felix.\r\nRespondent�s False Accusations and Edited Video Evidence\r\nRespondent originally submitted an edited 12 minute video to the Court, which she admitted was incomplete. The full video, which is over 40 minutes long, was intentionally reduced to then 30 minutes to remove exculpatory evidence and given to Micheal.\r\nIn the video, Petitioner explicitly states, �I see you recording, so let�s get this out of the way so we can have a relationship with our son.� He then lists hypothetical statements a �bad father� might make, which Respondent has since misrepresented as threats.\r\nRespondent�s manipulation of evidence constitutes perjury and a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court.\r\n\r\nII. RESPONDENT�S PATTERN OF MISCONDUCT\r\nRespondent�s Lies Under Oath\r\nRespondent has repeatedly lied under oath, including:\r\nClaiming Petitioner �kicked her out� of the house, despite testifying in court that she left voluntarily each week.\r\nFailing to disclose her collusion with Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove to fabricate Petitioner�s living situation.\r\nMisrepresenting the contents of the video evidence submitted to the Court.\r\nClaiming Petitioner�s housing is unstable, while being the culprit.\r\nRespondent�s Willful Parental Interference\r\nRespondent has consistently interfered with Petitioner�s relationship with Felix by:\r\nDenying Petitioner access to the child without justification.\r\nRefusing to comply with court-ordered visitation schedules.\r\nManipulating the child�s perception of Petitioner through false narratives.\r\nYelling, talking, and demonstrating unstable co-parenting skills in front of Felix during Petitioner's court appointed time forcing narrative.\r\n\r\nIII. REQUEST FOR RELIEF\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nCompel Respondent to Testify Under Oath\r\nRequire Respondent to testify regarding her claims of fear, her collusion with third parties, and her manipulation of evidence.\r\nHold Respondent in Contempt\r\nFind Respondent in contempt for:\r\nPerjury and willful misrepresentation to the Court.\r\nParental interference and violation of Petitioner�s custodial rights.\r\nManipulation of evidence to mislead the Court.\r\nGrant Remedial Relief\r\nInvalidate the temporary custody order obtained through fraudulent means.\r\nStrike everything Crycella submitted from record.\r\nOrder supervised visitation to restore Petitioner�s relationship with Felix.\r\nRequire Crycella to undergo a psychological evaluation to assess her fitness as a custodial parent.\r\nHave Crycella return all Micheal�s property - (PC)\r\nAward Petitioner attorney�s fees and costs incurred due to Respondent�s misconduct of no less than $60,000 for all the work attributed in the courts bias.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.`

    date: "2025-17-3",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Pro Se, and moves this Court to review and compel the Stone County Circuit Clerk�s office to comply with its obligations under the Local Court Rules and the Missouri Sunshine Law. The Clerk�s refusal to schedule my emergency motion on the designated Motion Day and its misrepresentation of the hearing date constitute misconduct and obstruct my right to due process and timely relief.\r\n\r\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nEmergency Motion Filed on March 13, 2025:\r\nOn March 13, 2025, I filed an Emergency Motion to Enforce and Protect Parental Communication Rights (hereinafter �Emergency Motion�). This motion was filed in good faith to address urgent issues affecting my parental rights and the well-being of my child.\r\nProper Motion Day for Associate Division I:\r\nPursuant to Local Rule 2.3.2, Motion Days for Associate Division I (presided over by the Hon. Matt A. Selby) occur on the second Friday of each month. For March 2025, the designated Motion Day was March 14, 2025.\r\nClerk�s Refusal to Schedule Motion on March 14, 2025:\r\nDespite filing my Emergency Motion one day before the designated Motion Day (March 13, 2025), the Clerk�s office refused to schedule the motion for March 14, 2025. When I called the Clerk�s office on March 14, 2025, I was informed that my motion was not scheduled for that day and was instead set for April 7, 2025.\r\nMisrepresentation of Hearing Date:\r\nThe Clerk�s office provided no explanation for why my Emergency Motion was not scheduled on the proper Motion Day. Instead, they misrepresented the hearing date, claiming it was set for April 7, 2025, which is not a designated Motion Day for Associate Division I.\r\nViolation of Local Rules and Due Process:\r\nThe Clerk�s actions violate Local Rule 2.3.2 and obstruct my right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. By delaying the hearing of my Emergency Motion, the Clerk�s office is causing irreparable harm to my parental rights and my child�s well-being.\r\n\r\nII. LEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nClerk�s Failure to Follow Local Rules:\r\nThe Clerk�s refusal to schedule my Emergency Motion on the designated Motion Day (March 14, 2025) violates Local Rule 2.3.2, which explicitly states that Motion Days for Associate Division I occur on the second Friday of each month.\r\nMisrepresentation of Hearing Date:\r\nThe Clerk�s office misrepresented the hearing date by claiming my motion was set for April 7, 2025, which is not a valid Motion Day for Associate Division I. This creates the appearance of bias and deliberate obstruction.\r\nViolation of Due Process:\r\nThe Clerk�s actions obstruct my right to due process by delaying the hearing of my Emergency Motion. Emergency motions are intended to address urgent matters, and any delay undermines their purpose and causes irreparable harm.\r\nFailure to Provide Public Records:\r\nDespite my formal requests under the Missouri Sunshine Law (RSMo � 610.010, et seq.), the Clerk�s office has refused to provide a list of scheduled motion hearings and other public records. This lack of transparency further obstructs my ability to advocate for my rights.\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, I respectfully request that this Court:\r\nOrder the Clerk�s Office to immediately provide a list of all motion hearings scheduled from March 1, 2025, to April 7, 2025, including the case numbers, parties involved, and hearing types.\r\nCompel the Clerk�s Office to provide a written explanation as to why my Emergency Motion was not scheduled on the designated Motion Day (March 14, 2025) and why it was instead set for April 7, 2025.\r\nReview the Clerk�s scheduling actions for potential misconduct, including violations of Local Court Rules and the Missouri Sunshine Law.\r\nSet my Emergency Motion for the earliest valid Motion Day in accordance with Local Rule 2.3.2.\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.`

LEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nViolation of Due Process:\r\nThe actions of the Court, the Clerk�s office, and opposing counsel have violated my right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBy ignoring my motions, misrepresenting hearing dates, and failing to address misconduct, the Court has denied me the opportunity to present my case and obtain timely relief.\r\nJudicial Misconduct:\r\nThe Court�s failure to address the Clerk�s misconduct and its refusal to schedule my motions on designated Motion Days constitute judicial misconduct under Missouri Supreme Court Rule 2.\r\nThe Court�s actions have created an appearance of bias and unfairness that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.\r\nClerk�s Misconduct:\r\nThe Clerk�s refusal to follow Local Court Rules and provide public records violates RSMo � 610.010, et seq. (Missouri Sunshine Law) and obstructs my right to access the court.\r\nOpposing Counsel�s Bad-Faith Tactics:\r\nMr. Garrett�s actions, including the submission of edited video evidence and reliance on false testimony, constitute bad-faith litigation tactics that have prejudiced my case and misled the Court.\r\nIrreparable Harm:\r\nThe cumulative effect of these actions has caused irreparable harm to my parental rights and my child�s well-being. Further proceedings in this case would only compound this harm and perpetuate the unfair treatment I have experienced.\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, I respectfully request that this Court:\r\nDismiss all pending matters in this case due to the pervasive judicial and procedural misconduct that has obstructed my right to due process and a fair hearing.\r\nIssue a written order detailing the Court�s findings regarding the misconduct of the Clerk�s office, opposing counsel, and the Court itself.\r\nRefer this matter to the Missouri Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges for further investigation into the judicial misconduct that has occurred in this case.\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.`

    title: "Letter to Judge Selby",
    date: "2025-25-3",
    type: "Letter",
    status: "OverRuled",
    content: `Dear Judge Selby,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Court�s notice of hearing for March 26th, 2025 at 10:30 a.m - \r\nI am writing to formally address the ongoing violations of my rights and the court�s repeated failure to apply legal standards fairly in my custody case. This letter serves as an official request for written clarification on multiple legal errors and procedural violations that have obstructed my ability to seek justice. As established in State ex rel. Houska v. Dickhaner, 323 S.W.3d 29 (Mo. 2010), mandamus is appropriate when a court fails to perform duties required by law or abuses its discretion in ways that cannot be adequately remedied through ordinary appeals. The pattern of procedural violations in this case meets this standard.\r\n1. The Unlawful Basis for the Temporary Custody Order\r\nMissouri law is clear on the requirements for granting a temporary custody order: Imminent Danger Standard (RSMo 210.125): Emergency custody can only be granted if there is reasonable cause to believe a child is in immediate danger due to abuse or neglect. Temporary Custody Orders (RSMo 452.380): Courts must rely on clear, supporting evidence demonstrating that a change in custody is in the child�s best interest.\r\nThe sole justification for granting the temporary custody motion was the false testimony of Jozef Hanratty, who falsely claimed I was facing eviction. The court itself acknowledged that if I remained in my residence the following week, it would prove Jozef�s dishonesty.\r\nOne week later, I was still in my residence, confirming the perjury committed by Hanratty. Despite this, my motion to dismiss was ignored. Furthermore, I have since submitted multiple documents proving Jozef and Crycella�s dishonesty, including:\r\nA letter from Kelly Truelove�s attorney validating my lawful tenancy.\r\nVideo evidence of Crycella denying my court-ordered communication with Felix.\r\nFormal legal documents disproving the eviction claim.\r\nYet, the court has refused to review this clear and irrefutable evidence, allowing an unlawful ruling to stand in direct violation of due process. Mr. Garrett has facilitated this unlawful and in bad faith conspiracy to purge me of my residence.\r\nThe Missouri Supreme Court in In re Marriage of Hendrix, 183 S.W.3d 582 (Mo. 2006), established that modifications to custody must be supported by substantial evidence demonstrating that a change would serve the child's best interests. The court's continued reliance on Mr. Hanratty's demonstrably false testimony violates this standard. Furthermore, in Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d 30 (Mo. 1976), the court established that judicial decisions must be supported by substantial evidence and cannot be against the weight of the evidence. The refusal to consider my documentary proof directly contradicts this foundational principle of Missouri law.\r\n2. Due Process Violations and the Court�s Pattern of Dismissal\r\nFor nearly two months, I have submitted repeated requests for enforcement of court orders, sanctions for perjury, and responses to procedural violations. Instead of legal resolution, I have been met with deliberate inaction, refusal to acknowledge evidence, and arbitrary denials of my motions. The following concerns require immediate explanation:\r\nWhy has the court repeatedly refused to review my submitted evidence?\r\nWhy have I been denied an opportunity to properly present my case, with time limits imposed despite the complexity and volume of the evidence?\r\nWhy has the court failed to enforce its own orders when Crycella continues to violate custody agreements and deny communication?\r\nWhat standard of proof is this court applying, and why is it selectively disregarding evidence that disproves the opposing party�s claims?\r\nThe refusal to provide transparency on these legal issues does not just harm me�it sets a precedent that erodes public trust in the judicial system. The United States Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), recognized that parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children. This court's repeated refusal to review submitted evidence and provide a fair hearing violates this constitutionally protected right. As established in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), procedural due process requires balancing the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation through current procedures, and the government's interest. The current proceedings fail this constitutional test by systematically denying my opportunity to present evidence that directly refutes the claims upon which the temporary order was based.\r\n3. The Court�s Direct Role in Facilitating the Destruction of Parental Rights\r\nThe law recognizes that continued separation from a parent is inherently damaging to a child. If the court is genuinely operating in Felix�s best interest, it must answer the following:\r\nHow does prolonged separation from a fit and loving parent benefit Felix�s well-being?\r\nWhat specific needs was Felix not receiving while in my care?\r\nWhy has the court refused to provide a formal reason for my denied custody and visitation rights?\r\nYour refusal to address these questions has directly enabled the obstruction of my parental rights, and the damage inflicted upon my relationship with Felix may soon become irreparable. In Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972), the Supreme Court held that parents are entitled to a hearing on their fitness before their children can be removed from their custody. This court has effectively bypassed this requirement by maintaining separation without proper evidentiary basis. The Missouri Court of Appeals in Searcy v. Searcy, 38 S.W.3d 462 (Mo. App. 2001), emphasized that the best interest of the child standard requires consideration of the child's need for meaningful contact with both parents. The prolonged and unjustified separation from Felix directly contradicts this established legal principle.\r\n4. Judicial Negligence Has Resulted in a Legal Imbalance\r\nYour Honor, in a courtroom, both parties must be held to the same standard. Yet, Mr. Garrett and Crycella have been permitted to:\r\nCommit perjury without consequence.\r\nIgnore court orders without penalty.\r\nRefuse transparency while I am forced to provide full financial disclosure.\r\nWithhold communications and legal documentation necessary for my case.\r\nMeanwhile, I have faced relentless obstruction in my efforts to simply ensure fairness.\r\n5. The Court�s Failure to Address These Issues Will Be Part of the Official Record\r\nAs established in Nazeri v. Missouri Valley College, 860 S.W.2d 303 (Mo. 1993), courts have an obligation to consider evidence properly submitted. The systematic dismissal of my evidence without explanation violates this fundamental judicial responsibility. For the purposes of creating a clear record for appeal under the standards set forth in Murphy v. Carron, I request specific findings regarding what evidence the court has considered and the legal basis for dismissing verified documentation that directly contradicts opposing counsel's claims.\r\nTo ensure clarity and for the purposes of an appeal, I request that the following be addressed:\r\nWhat specific evidence does this court consider insufficient, and by what legal standard is it being dismissed?\r\nHas the court reviewed the video evidence of Crycella violating my custody rights?\r\nWhat authority does Mr. Garrett have in determining custody arrangements, and why has he been given the authority to refuse communication between me and my son?\r\nWhy has the court failed to enforce its own orders while simultaneously penalizing me for procedural actions that I have lawfully followed?\r\nWhat additional evidence does the court require to correct its clear bias?\r\n6. This Court Must Take Responsibility for the Harm It Has Caused\r\nThe failure to fairly enforce the law has emboldened Crycella to continue violating my rights without fear of consequence. This is not just a failure of one case�it is an institutional failure that undermines the very function of the judicial system. This court�s failure to enforce the law fairly has created an environment where Crycella feels emboldened to violate my rights with impunity, effectively destroying any chance at a meaningful parent-child relationship. Your Honor, awarding fees to Crycella and Mr. Garrett in this case would set a dangerous precedent�one where pro se litigants who uncover procedural errors are penalized financially while attorneys who fail to address these errors get rewarded. The work I have done vastly exceeds Mr. Garrett�s, and it was necessitated by his and the court�s own failures. \r\nI demand a formal, on-the-record response to these issues before my upcoming hearing and request that this letter be entered into the official record of these proceedings.`

The actions of Judge Matt Alan Selby demonstrate a willful and persistent failure to perform duties, a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and conduct that brings the judiciary into disrepute.\r\nCase No. 24SN-DR00104\r\nAllegations of Judicial Misconduct:\r\nWillful Failure to Perform Duties & Due Process Violations\r\nJudge Matt Alan Selby has systematically ignored and refused to rule on numerous motions that were properly filed and served.\r\nThis refusal to address critical legal matters has directly prejudiced my case and deprived me of my constitutional right to a fair hearing.\r\nBias and Unequal Treatment of Litigants\r\nThe judge has demonstrated a pattern of favoring the opposing party, including responding to their informal communications while refusing to address my formal filings.\r\nIn one instance, the judge ignored my submitted physical evidence, refused to accept it, then ruled in the opposing counsel's favor because he had to pick his kids up from school.\r\nFailure to Adhere to Court Procedures & Judicial Ethics\r\nThe judge has acted in contravention of judicial standards by failing to issue written orders on key matters, making it impossible to properly appeal rulings.\r\nThe judge has permitted opposing counsel to violate procedural rules without consequence while holding me, as a pro se litigant, to a different standard.\r\nConduct Bringing the Judiciary into Disrepute\r\nThe judge�s refusal to rule on properly submitted filings, coupled with apparent bias, has created the appearance of impropriety and diminished public confidence in the court�s ability to function impartially.\r\nRequested Action:\r\nGiven the severity of these violations, I respectfully request the Commission conduct a full investigation intoJudge Matt Alan Selby�s misconduct. I urge the Commission to consider formal disciplinary action, including reprimand, suspension, or referral to the Missouri Supreme Court for removal, if appropriate.\r\nI have attached supporting documents, including copies of my motions, court transcripts, and any relevant communications, to substantiate my claims. I am available to provide further information or testimony as needed.\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.`

In support thereof, Movant states as follows:\r\n1. Judicial Misconduct and Bias\r\nThe Court repeatedly misrepresented Movant�s statements on record, requiring Movant to repeat himself multiple times while the judge feigned confusion.\r\nThe Court�s behavior resulted in material distortion of the record, which may severely impact appellate review and deprives Movant of a fair hearing.\r\nThe Court manipulated the proceedings to align with a predetermined outcome, ignoring relevant facts and legal arguments presented by Movant.\r\nThe court refused three occasions of preliminary questions that would assist Movant.\r\n2. Denial of Due Process\r\nThe Webex hearing was improperly terminated, preventing Movant from asking critical questions and further clarifying mischaracterized statements.\r\nThe Court disregarded prior motions and filings, forcing Movant to resubmit information that had already been placed on record, thereby delaying resolution and causing undue burden.\r\nThe Court allowed opposing counsel, Josh Garrett, to unilaterally dictate supervision terms without review or proper legal authority.\r\n3. Failure to Enforce Custody and Visitation Rights\r\nMovant has been wrongfully denied visitation with his child, Felix, for over two months, in direct violation of prior orders and Missouri custody laws.\r\nThe Court failed to take action despite acknowledging that Respondent, Crycella Freitag, was in violation of previous orders.\r\nThe Court�s inaction effectively condones Respondent�s noncompliance, further alienating Movant from his child and undermining the best interests of the minor.\r\n4. Misconduct by Opposing Counsel\r\nOpposing counsel, Josh Garrett, falsely framed a prior phone call to paint Movant in a negative light, attempting to distort the record.\r\nThe Court, while acknowledging a \"grey area,\" nonetheless failed to hold Respondent accountable for her refusal to comply with court-ordered visitation.\r\nOpposing counsel has continuously acted in bad faith by obstructing Movant�s parental rights, yet the Court continues to allow his undue influence over supervision arrangements.\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nCorrect the official court record to reflect Movant�s actual statements, as opposed to the judge�s mischaracterizations.\r\nProvide Movant with an opportunity to clarify any outstanding issues unfairly cut off during the Webex hearing.\r\nImmediately enforce prior visitation orders and sanction Respondent for willful noncompliance.\r\nRemove opposing counsel�s undue influence over supervision arrangements and assign an impartial third party.\r\nIssue any further relief deemed just and proper in the interest of fairness and due process.\r\nPETITIONER�S MOTION FOR HEARING AND REVIEW\r\nCOMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court set a hearing and conduct a review on March 31, 2025, to address the numerous accusations and questions that the Court has refused to acknowledge throughout these proceedings. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nPetitioner has submitted multiple motions highlighting critical procedural failures, judicial bias concerns, and violations of due process that have yet to be properly acknowledged or adjudicated.\r\nThe Court has failed to respond to or act upon key motions and court orders, creating an unfair and prejudicial environment against Petitioner.\r\nThe Court has provided responses to the opposing counsel�s submissions while refusing to address direct communications and concerns raised by Petitioner, further demonstrating bias and procedural misconduct.\r\nPetitioner asserts that the failure to address these issues has resulted in continued harm and an obstruction of justice, warranting immediate review and resolution.\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nA. Schedule a hearing on March 31, 2025, to review all unacknowledged accusations and procedural concerns raised by Petitioner; B. Address and provide rulings on all outstanding motions previously submitted by Petitioner; C. Ensure a fair and unbiased review of all concerns that have been improperly dismissed or ignored; D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

    date: "2025-27-3",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to:\r\nCompel Counter-Respondent Freitag to immediately schedule and pay for Movant�s psychological evaluation as ordered by this Court on February 25, 2025.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrike the fraudulent statement in the March 26 Notice of Entry, which incorrectly claims that Movant was ordered to \"file\" a psychological evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSanction Counter-Respondent Freitag and Attorney Garrett for their noncompliance with the Court�s February 25 order and their misrepresentation to the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUNDS FOR RELIEF\r\nThe February 25, 2025 Order Clearly Required Counter-Respondent Freitag to Arrange and Pay for the Psychological Evaluation.\r\n\r\n The Court�s original order (Exhibit A) specifically states:\r\n \"Counter-Respondent (Freitag) shall arrange and pay for Movant�s psychological evaluation.\"\r\n Despite this explicit directive, Counter-Respondent Freitag has failed to comply for over 30 days. Nevertheless, the March 26 Notice of Entry falsely states that Movant was ordered to obtain the evaluation, thus inaccurately portraying Movant as noncompliant.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial Fraud on the Record.\r\n\r\n The March 26 Notice claims:\r\n \"Movant was ordered to obtain a psychological examination on February 25, 2025.\"\r\n This statement is demonstrably false. As the attached order (Exhibit A) clearly indicates, the responsibility to arrange and pay for the evaluation was placed on Counter-Respondent Freitag, not Movant. This misrepresentation has prejudiced Movant by casting a false light on his compliance with court orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelegation of Judicial Responsibilities to Opposing Counsel.\r\n\r\n In a recent phone call with the Clerk�s Office (Exhibit C), the Clerk confirmed:\r\n \"The judge said you need to contact Mr. Garrett for next steps.\"\r\n This is a violation of Missouri Code of Judicial Conduct 2.2, which prohibits judges from delegating their judicial responsibilities to opposing counsel. Mr. Garrett has no legal authority to dictate the Court�s orders. This conduct undermines the integrity of these proceedings and violates Movant�s rights to a fair and impartial process.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nMovant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nOrder Counter-Respondent Freitag to schedule and pay for the psychological evaluation within 48 hours of this motion�s filing or hold Counter-Respondent Freitag in contempt of court for failing to comply with the February 25, 2025 order.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrike the false statement in the March 26 Notice of Entry which claims that Movant was ordered to obtain the psychological evaluation, correcting the record to reflect the true terms of the February 25 order.\r\n\r\n\r\nSanction Counter-Respondent Freitag and Attorney Garrett for their continued noncompliance and misrepresentation of the Court�s orders, as outlined above.\r\n\r\n\r\nClarify that the judge�not opposing counsel�must rule on motions and make determinations regarding procedural matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOF OF FRAUD (FILED EXHIBITS)\r\nExhibit A: February 25, 2025 Order, showing Counter-Respondent Freitag�s obligation to arrange and pay for the evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExhibit B: March 26, 2025 Notice of Entry, highlighting the fraudulent statement regarding the responsibility for the psychological evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExhibit C: Call log/recording from Clerk�s Office, confirming the judge�s improper delegation of responsibilities to opposing counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL WARNING TO THE COURT\r\nAs the Missouri Court of Appeals is currently reviewing this case:\r\nCourt of Appeals Case No. SD38905\r\nMovant formally requests the Court take immediate action to correct these issues. If the Court fails to address these concerns promptly:\r\nMovant will file a judicial misconduct complaint against the judge and counsel involved in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovant will seek federal intervention under 42 U.S.C. � 1983 for violations of constitutional rights, including due process and equal protection.`

    status: "Pending",
    content: `NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court for an immediate ruling on all pending motions, an award of sole legal and physical custody, child support, and legal fees, based on the following:\r\nI. MOTION FOR PROMPT RULING ON PENDING MOTIONS\r\nMovant has filed multiple motions essential to the fair adjudication of this case, yet they remain unresolved despite proper service and presentation to the Court.\r\nThe lack of rulings has caused significant prejudice to Movant, including but not limited to:\r\nHindrance of Movant�s ability to exercise court-ordered parenting time.\r\nProcedural confusion due to the Court�s failure to enforce compliance.\r\nLack of legal clarity, creating an unfair advantage for Respondent.\r\nFailure to rule on these motions constitutes judicial inaction, violating Movant�s due process rights and judicial efficiency principles.\r\nMovant requests an immediate ruling on all pending motions, including a written explanation for any motion the Court declines to rule on.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nIssue rulings on all outstanding motions without further delay;\r\nProvide a written explanation for any motion the Court declines to rule on; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\nII. MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE AWARD OF MAKEUP PARENTING TIME DUE TO COURT-CAUSED PREJUDICE\r\nOn 03/26/2025, this Court issued a correction acknowledging prior procedural errors that contributed to delays in Movant�s parenting time.\r\nThese delays were not caused by Movant but rather by court-recognized procedural failures and Respondent�s noncompliance.\r\nAs a direct result, Movant has suffered a significant and unjust loss of time with his child, which has harmed the parent-child relationship.\r\nThe Court has both the authority and the obligation to rectify this harm by awarding immediate and uninterrupted makeup parenting time.\r\nMovant requests that the full amount of lost time be restored in an expedited manner.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nOrder immediate makeup parenting time for the full amount of time lost due to court delays;\r\nSet an expedited schedule for the makeup time; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and necessary.\r\nIII. MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST RESPONDENT FOR MISREPRESENTATION AND NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS\r\nThe Court�s recent correction confirms that Respondent engaged in misrepresentation regarding the execution of prior orders.\r\nRespondent�s deliberate mischaracterization of the Court�s directive resulted in an unjustified loss of Movant�s parenting time.\r\nThe Court has the inherent authority to sanction parties who act in bad faith and obstruct justice.\r\nMovant requests that this Court impose appropriate sanctions, including but not limited to:\r\nMonetary sanctions for attorney�s fees and costs incurred due to Respondent�s misrepresentation.\r\nCompensatory sanctions in the form of additional parenting time beyond standard makeup time.\r\nJudicial warnings or contempt findings to deter further misconduct.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nIssue sanctions against Respondent for bad faith conduct;\r\nAward compensatory relief in the form of additional parenting time; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\nIV. MOTION FOR SOLE CUSTODY, CHILD SUPPORT, AND LEGAL FEES\r\nGiven the documented history of Respondent�s noncompliance, obstruction, and misrepresentation, it is in the best interest of the minor child that Movant be awarded sole legal and physical custody.\r\nRespondent has demonstrated a pattern of behavior that prioritizes obstruction over the well-being of the child, necessitating a change in custody.\r\nMovant has provided a stable and supportive environment, and granting sole custody will ensure the child�s best interests are met.\r\nMovant requests that Respondent be ordered to pay child support in accordance with statutory guidelines, retroactive to the date of initial filing.\r\nGiven Respondent�s bad faith conduct, Movant also seeks an award of legal fees incurred due to unnecessary litigation caused by Respondent�s actions.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nAward Movant sole legal and physical custody of the minor child;\r\nOrder Respondent to pay child support, retroactive to 1 year;\r\nAward Movant all previous motions in full;\r\nOrder Respondent to pay Movant�s legal fees; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.`

    status: "Granted",
    content: `NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully submits into evidence the official court dismissal of the eviction action filed against him by Kelly Truelove, which directly undermines the opposing party�s claims regarding his living situation and exposes a pattern of conspiracy and bad faith litigation. In support of this motion, Movant states as follows:\r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe basis for Counter-Respondent�s claims against Movant has been the false assertion that Movant�s living situation was unstable, a claim purportedly supported by an eviction proceeding initiated by Kelly Truelove.\r\nOn 03/21/2025, the eviction case filed by Kelly Truelove was officially dismissed.\r\nThis dismissal, occurring without an adjudication on the merits, demonstrates that the eviction claim itself was either legally unfounded or strategically abandoned, undermining any assertion that Movant�s residence was unstable or unsuitable for parenting time.\r\nEVIDENCE OF COLLUSION AND BAD FAITH\r\nCounter-Respondent, through her attorney Josh Garrett, has relied on the purported eviction to bolster her case against Movant, despite lacking any valid legal foundation.\r\nAttorney Josh Garrett has admitted to direct communication with Kelly Truelove regarding Movant�s residence, indicating a coordinated effort to fabricate instability in order to justify denying Movant custody rights.\r\nThe involvement of multiple parties in propagating this false narrative constitutes a deliberate conspiracy to prejudice Movant�s case through fraudulent claims and misuse of legal procedures.\r\nThis Court has a duty to recognize and act upon evidence of bad faith litigation tactics, particularly where such actions have materially impacted Movant�s parental rights and due process protections.\r\nLEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nThe submission of evidence demonstrating fraud upon the court and coordinated deception is both relevant and necessary for the just resolution of this case.\r\nCourts have an inherent authority to sanction parties who engage in bad faith litigation and to ensure that judgments are rendered based on factual and legal integrity rather than manufactured falsehoods.\r\nThe dismissal of the eviction action negates the sole argument advanced by Counter-Respondent regarding Movant�s alleged instability and further justifies the granting of full custody to Movant.\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nAccept the official dismissal of the eviction case as submitted evidence in the appeal and present case;\r\nRecognize the coordinated effort to misrepresent Movant�s living situation and consider such actions in the Court�s final determinations;\r\nIssue any necessary sanctions or corrective actions to address the bad faith conduct of Counter-Respondent and her counsel;\r\nGrant any other relief this Court deems just and proper.`

  date: "2025-05-23",
  type: "Petition",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `PETITION AND MOTION TO VACATE/SET ASIDE CONTEMPT ORDER, FOR STAY OF ENFORCEMENT, AND FOR OTHER RELIEF
COMES NOW Respondent, Micheal Salmon, and respectfully petitions this Court to vacate and set aside its Order for Commitment entered on May 22, 2025, and for such other and further relief as the Court deems just, and as grounds therefore states:

I. INTRODUCTION & SUMMARY
Respondent is a judicial auditor and public interest advocate, whose work is focused on transparency and accountability in Missouri’s courts, including the 39th Judicial Circuit.
Respondent’s due process rights were violated when the Court conducted a contempt hearing in his absence, after canceling his WebEx access two days before trial and providing no alternative means to attend.
Respondent objects to all findings and conclusions in the Order for Commitment, except that he does not presently challenge the custody order, reserving his right to do so in Kansas.

II. OBJECTIONS TO THE ORDER FOR COMMITMENT
A. Lack of Due Process – U.S. Const. Amend. XIV; Mo. Const. Art. I, § 10
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Missouri Constitution guarantee due process of law before deprivation of liberty.
Respondent was denied due process when:
The Court canceled his WebEx access two days before the hearing (see attached Exhibit A: WebEx cancellation notice).
No alternative means to participate were provided, despite Respondent’s out-of-state residence and inability to appear in person.
The Court proceeded in absentia, without ensuring Respondent had notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard, in violation of In re Marriage of Hendrix, 183 S.W.3d 582, 589 (Mo. banc 2006) (due process requires notice and opportunity to be heard).
B. Improper Notice and Service – Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 43.01, 43.02
Missouri Supreme Court Rules 43.01 and 43.02 require proper service and notice of hearings. Respondent did not receive adequate notice of the contempt hearing, nor was he given a reasonable opportunity to prepare and respond.
C. Violation of Open Courts and Public Interest – Mo. Const. Art. I, § 14; RSMo § 476.170
Missouri’s Constitution and statutes guarantee open courts and public access to judicial proceedings, except in narrowly defined circumstances. The blanket application of confidentiality to all paternity actions (RSMo § 210.846) does not override the public’s right to scrutinize judicial conduct, especially where the focus is on judicial accountability, not private party information.
D. Overbreadth and Prior Restraint – U.S. Const. Amend. I; Mo. Const. Art. I, § 8
The Court’s order to “immediately remove all videos” is unconstitutionally overbroad and constitutes a prior restraint on speech, in violation of the First Amendment and Article I, Section 8 of the Missouri Constitution. See Nebraska Press Ass’n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976).
E. Impossibility of Compliance – RSMo § 476.110; Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 41.02
Respondent made good faith efforts to comply but was unable to remove all content due to technical impossibility and third-party republication. Missouri law does not permit contempt sanctions where compliance is impossible. See State ex rel. Mo. State Highway Comm’n v. Weinstein, 322 S.W.2d 778, 783 (Mo. 1959).
F. Improper Findings of Willfulness – RSMo § 476.110
The Court’s findings of willfulness are unsupported by evidence and contrary to the record, which shows Respondent’s repeated attempts to communicate, comply, and request accommodations.
G. Improper Application of Local Rules – Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 1.02
Local court rules cannot override constitutional rights or state statutes. The Court’s reliance on local rules to prohibit recording is unlawful where such rules conflict with higher authority.
H. Contempt Directed at the Courts
The assertion that Respondent’s actions show “a complete lack of respect for the courts” is unfounded and punitive. Respondent’s conduct is motivated by a good faith belief in the necessity of public oversight and judicial accountability.

III. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Vacate and set aside the Order for Commitment entered May 22, 2025;
B. Stay enforcement of any capias or commitment order pending resolution of this motion and any appeal or collateral challenge in Kansas;
C. Order a new hearing with proper notice and access, ensuring Respondent’s participation by remote means if necessary;
D. Make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to each of Respondent’s objections;
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

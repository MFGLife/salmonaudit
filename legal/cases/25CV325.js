      title: "Motion for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, with Notice of Anticipated Class Certification Following Discovery",
      date: "2025-04-22",
      type: "Motion",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `COMES NOW Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon (“Plaintiff”), pursuant to K.S.A. § 60-223 and
    Rule 23 of the Kansas Rules of Civil Procedure, and respectfully moves this Court to certify this
    matter as a class action and grant declaratory and injunctive relief as follows:
    I. INTRODUCTION
    This action arises from the systematic, unauthorized, and procedurally unlawful conduct of The
    Layne Project, Inc.—a third-party entity repeatedly empowered by Kansas courts without
    adequate oversight, transparency, or legal foundation. The Layne Project acted without
    Plaintiff’s consent, outside judicial order, and against explicit, on-record objections. These
    actions caused measurable harm to Plaintiff and, based on extensive research and
    correspondence, a substantial number of similarly situated parents across Kansas.
    In addition, the involvement of outside actors, churches, and witness networks connected to
    court activity—specifically Christ Connect Church and individuals operating under religious or
    informal authority—has led to an expanded pattern of coordinated misconduct.
    This case addresses institutional collusion, witness manipulation, due process violations, and
    covert communication pipelines between unregulated entities and judicial actors—all shielded
    from public scrutiny.
    II. CLASS ACTION CRITERIA
    
    Page 1 of 7
    
    Plaintiff seeks certification on behalf of all persons within Kansas who, within the last five years:
    ● Were referred to The Layne Project for supervised visitation, parenting services, or
    custody-related evaluations without opportunity to formally object or without transparent
    documentation of referral;
    ● Were subjected to undisclosed, unilateral communication between The Layne Project
    and judicial actors without notice or consent;
    ● Were subjected to inconsistent and opaque financial practices that masked eligibility for
    fee waivers or falsely imposed financial obligations;
    ● Were subjected to non-governmental surveillance, uncredentialed observation, or
    informal church-backed “testimony” presented under the guise of moral authority;
    ● Suffered procedural, financial, and familial harm as a result of The Layne Project’s
    unauthorized role in judicial proceedings and its referral partnerships with informal
    institutions and personal contacts of the involved parties.
    
    The proposed class satisfies the requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and
    adequacy as detailed under K.S.A. § 60-223.
    III. STATEMENT OF FACTS
    A. Unauthorized Judicial Influence
    Without court order or Plaintiff’s consent, The Layne Project inserted itself into active litigation
    involving Plaintiff’s parental rights. It communicated directly with the court behind closed doors,
    influencing orders and recommendations while Plaintiff's timely objections were ignored or
    omitted from the record.
    B. Subpoena Stonewalled
    Plaintiff submitted multiple formal motions for subpoenas to uncover communications and
    procedural corruption tied to The Layne Project, Joshua Garrett, Kelly Truelove, and associated
    third parties. These requests remain unaddressed or delayed under vague procedural
    justifications, exposing systemic avoidance tactics.
    C. Collusion with Christ Connect Church and Improper Witness Behavior
    Members of Christ Connect Church, specifically Natasha and Robert Kluttz, submitted witness
    statements admitting to "monitoring" Plaintiff’s behavior without formal licensing or
    appointment. These statements were used in court to support claims of instability, while their
    association with referral relationships to The Layne Project remains undisclosed. Plaintiff’s
    own mother, Carolyn Salmon, has coordinated behind the scenes to support this narrative and
    facilitate church-based involvement in legal matters under the pretense of moral oversight.
    D. False Financial Barriers
    The Layne Project initially denied services absent full payment. Later, it was revealed—only after
    
    Page 2 of 7
    
    persistent inquiry—that fee waivers were available but withheld until arbitrary documentation
    was submitted. This misrepresentation directly interfered with Plaintiff’s right to visitation.
    E. Pattern of Obstruction
    Over a three-month period, The Layne Project refused to produce policies, communication
    records, or any documents related to their handling of Plaintiff’s case. Meanwhile, associated
    parties provided court with selective witness statements meant to simulate credibility while
    withholding context, personal connections, and conflicts of interest.
    IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF
    Plaintiff satisfies all criteria for class certification under K.S.A. § 60-223 and seeks equitable
    relief under Kansas civil procedure and constitutional doctrine. The harms in this case are not
    isolated—they are institutionalized, recurring, and designed to undermine due process through
    informal influence and procedural opacity.
    Numerosity: Hundreds of Kansas families are estimated to be affected annually.
    Commonality: Core legal issues arise from shared fact patterns.
    Typicality: Plaintiff’s experience mirrors that of many other victims of The Layne Project’s
    interference.
    Adequacy: Plaintiff has created a public-facing, transparent legal archive and audit system to
    ensure full class participation and documentation:
    V. RELIEF REQUESTED
    Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
    1. Certify this matter as a class action under K.S.A. § 60-223;
    2. Order The Layne Project and any associated institutions, including Christ Connect
    Church, to produce all communications related to case referrals, surveillance, witness
    coaching, or financial transactions;
    3. Declare that The Layne Project’s conduct, and the use of informal, uncredentialed
    witness participation coordinated through religious or private community institutions,
    violates Kansas due process protections;
    4. Enjoin The Layne Project and any partner institutions from participating in any legal
    matter involving Kansas families without:
    ○ Prior consent from both parties;
    ○ Transparent referral agreements;
    ○ Disclosure of all affiliations and conflicts;
    5. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper, including the preservation
    of whistleblower protection for future class members coming forward.

    NOTICE OF PATTERNED ENTERPRISE ACTIVITY INVOKING RICO
    STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
    COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully submits this
    supplemental motion in connection with the pending class action, to provide notice of the
    existence of a broader, structured pattern of misconduct consistent with the federal standards
    outlined in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§
    1961–1968.
    This supplemental notice is not a full RICO filing at this time but is provided for the Court’s
    awareness and possible future severance or referral to appropriate jurisdiction.
    I. BACKGROUND AND ENTERPRISE ELEMENTS
    Plaintiff has identified conduct across multiple actors which—when considered
    together—suggest the existence of a coordinated enterprise acting in a manner consistent with
    RICO's definition of an "association-in-fact" enterprise. This includes:
    ● The Layne Project, Inc., operating without transparency or oversight while coordinating
    ex parte with courts and family law attorneys;
    ● Crycella and Amanda Freitag, Stephanie Reed, Tyler Brown; police and court
    manipulation, kidnapping, perjury
    ● Joshua Garrett, attorney of record for the opposing party, shown to have direct referral
    and coordination ties with The Layne Project and non-legal actors;
    ● Natasha and Robert Kluttz, witnesses affiliated with Christ Connect Church, submitting
    extrajudicial surveillance testimony under religious or social cover;
    ● Carolyn Salmon, a close family member and silent actor whose role in facilitating
    improper contact, witness support, and moral framing remains ongoing and
    undocumented;
    ● Christ Connect Church, an entity which has maintained informal referral ties with Layne
    Project personnel and whose members act as unlicensed observers in custody cases.
    II. RICO RELEVANCE
    The structural, ongoing nature of these relationships satisfies the threshold for enterprise under
    RICO and introduces the possibility of:
    ● Witness tampering (18 U.S.C. § 1512)
    ● Obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503)
    ● Wire fraud via false affidavits and financial misrepresentations (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
    
    Page 4 of 7
    
    ● Extortion of parental rights via controlled access and manipulation of supervised
    visitation (18 U.S.C. § 1951)
    III. REQUEST FOR SEVERABLE RECOGNITION
    Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court acknowledge this supplemental filing as a stand-alone
    motion for future severance, referral, or expansion. This is not intended to alter the main class
    action framework but to preserve the record in anticipation of expanded relief being sought in
    either civil or federal court.
    WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Court:
    1. Accept this supplemental filing as judicial notice of an ongoing patterned enterprise;
    2. Permit severance of this issue if deemed prejudicial to the central class action matter;
    3. Allow discovery related to these individuals and entities to proceed under the RICO
    relevance standard;
    4. Provide any other relief the Court deems just and proper in light of this emergent
    structural pattern.
    
    MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PUBLICLY DISCLOSE SYSTEMIC
    CONFLICT NETWORKS
    COMES NOW Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court for a standing order
    requiring all named and involved entities—including public witnesses, court contractors, referral
    partners, and their associated religious or business organizations—to preserve and disclose any
    relationships that may constitute conflict of interest networks related to The Layne Project or
    custody-related case referrals over the last five (5) years.
    This motion also seeks judicial permission to maintain and publish a structured,
    non-confidential record of such networks for public and legal review under public accountability
    and transparency principles.
    I. BASIS FOR MOTION
    Plaintiff has uncovered and cataloged extensive overlap between personal, religious, and
    professional affiliations of parties testifying or influencing court activity, particularly:
    ● Church organizations (e.g., Christ Connect Church) submitting informal witness
    declarations tied to court influence;
    ● Undisclosed business relationships between said churches and The Layne Project;
    
    Page 5 of 7
    
    ● Personal coordination between witnesses (e.g., Natasha and Robert Kluttz), court
    officers, and therapists involved in custody assessments;
    ● Family-based suppression and triangulation, including the concealed role of Plaintiff’s
    mother, Carolyn Salmon, in guiding or manipulating narratives behind the scenes.
    II. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
    Plaintiff requests the Court:
    1. Order the preservation of communications and affiliations between witnesses, court
    officers, and religious or private organizations that have submitted information or had
    contact with this case;
    2. Permit the maintenance of a publicly viewable, evidence-based registry of witness
    affiliations and connections, which will be hosted at: https://salmonaudit.info/
    3. Recognize this preservation request as a proactive shield against future denial of
    coordination, tampering, or influence laundering across legal, social, and spiritual lines;
    4. Allow Plaintiff to continue organizing submissions from others affected by these referral
    and witness systems, as part of a broader pattern of court manipulation.
    III. WHY THIS MATTERS
    This motion is about prophylactic transparency. It gives the Court a choice:
    Either acknowledge the existence of improper relationships now,
    or face their exposure later—when it’s too late to act without consequence.
    If the parties involved have nothing to hide, they will comply.
    If not, their silence becomes evidentiary.
    WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an order compelling the above,
    and granting such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

  id: "2025CV325",
  title: "VERIFIED PETITION FOR DAMAGES, DISCOVERY, AND MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION",
  date: "2025-05-09",
  type: "Petition",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `This action arises out of a coordinated, sustained, and malicious campaign by private individuals and organizations to defame, isolate, and systemically harm the Plaintiff and other similarly situated parties through psychological coercion, false allegations, conspiratorial communications, and interference in familial, legal, and social relationships. The Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, brings this action both individually and in anticipation of certifying a broader class following discovery.
The currently named Defendants include individuals acting in both personal and professional capacities, with known communications among them indicating a shared agenda of parental alienation, reputational sabotage, and misuse of judicial and support systems. Discovery has been hindered by refusal to respond to formal inquiries, and substantial evidence is being actively concealed or deleted by Defendants. The conduct, if left unchecked, presents a pattern of modern coercive abuse enabled by unchecked familial and quasi-professional power structures.
I. JURISDICTION & VENUE
Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under K.S.A. § 60-308.
Venue is proper in Wyandotte County, Kansas, as the acts described occurred in this jurisdiction and involve ongoing harm to residents within this county, including the Plaintiff.
II. PARTIES
Plaintiff Micheal Lawrence Salmon is a resident of Wyandotte County, Kansas.
Defendant Trina Nudson is a caseworker and/or lawyer of The LANE Project, with whom Plaintiff has had multiple interactions concerning child welfare and legal disputes.
The LANE Project is believed to be operating under state-contracted authority and is named due to its enabling role in the conspiratorial and obstructive behavior described herein.
Defendants Carolyn Salmon, Chanille Dunn, Jesse Salmon, Crycella Freitag, Amanda Freitag, Christian Freitag, Stephanie Reed, and Nikki Kluttz are individuals with personal and/or professional ties to the Plaintiff and one another, who have engaged in coordinated conduct targeting Plaintiff.
Upon information and belief, communications among Defendants and with institutional actors reflect a collaborative effort to isolate, discredit, and harm the Plaintiff. Additional John and Jane Does will be named following discovery.
III. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff has documented a long-term pattern of harassment, defamation, interference, and control by the above-named individuals, resulting in loss of housing, child custody obstruction, reputational injury, and mental anguish.
Defendants have coordinated false narratives, weaponized third-party institutions (CPS, law enforcement, courts), and used digital platforms and social triangulation to isolate the Plaintiff from his child and support network.
Counsel representing Trina Nudson and/or The LANE Project has acknowledged discussions with Plaintiff regarding these matters but has failed to follow up or cooperate in good faith, further obstructing the Plaintiff's ability to gather evidence.
Plaintiff possesses over 80 gigabytes of audio, video, and document-based surveillance and data supporting the claims herein. However, critical digital evidence—particularly communications between Defendants—is known to be locked behind devices and cloud accounts requiring subpoena access. Plaintiff believes Defendants are actively deleting or concealing these records.
IV. CLASS FRAMEWORK AND DISCOVERY
Plaintiff brings this action individually and with the intention of moving to certify a class of similarly affected individuals following completion of discovery. The class is expected to include persons subjected to coercive familial abuse, malicious reporting, reputational sabotage, or child custody manipulation through networks of personal and institutional actors.
Plaintiff asserts that the conduct described is not isolated, but part of a growing pattern of coercive control enabled by overlapping personal and agency relationships that operate outside of judicial oversight.
Class certification is premature until digital communications and witness records can be obtained through formal discovery and forensic recovery. Plaintiff seeks judicial endorsement for a broad discovery plan and preservation order.
V. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
COUNT I – DEFAMATION
Defendants knowingly published and disseminated false statements about Plaintiff to third parties, including social services, courts, family members, and the general public, with malicious intent and without privilege.
COUNT II – COERCIVE CONTROL
Defendants employed systematic, psychological, and logistical strategies to isolate and dominate Plaintiff through manipulation of parental access, manufactured crises, and hostile third-party engagement.
COUNT III – CIVIL CONSPIRACY
Defendants entered into an agreement and/or understanding to engage in conduct calculated to harm Plaintiff and similarly situated individuals, evidenced through pattern behavior and known communications.
COUNT IV – TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE
Certain Defendants intentionally interfered with Plaintiff’s housing arrangements, landlord communications, custody rights, and employment prospects through dishonest and malicious acts.
VI. MEMORANDUM REGARDING PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION AND TRANSPARENCY
Petitioner hereby places this Court and all parties on notice that all proceedings, filings, and developments in this case will be publicly documented and archived for educational, safety, and transparency purposes. This documentation is fully protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as Kansas open records and public interest standards, and is being maintained in the interest of preserving an accurate historical record and ensuring accountability in a case involving significant civil rights and abuse allegations.
To the extent that any party or agent seeks to retaliate, suppress, or interfere with this documentation process, such actions will be treated as obstruction of justice, witness intimidation, or prior restraint, and appropriate motions will be filed immediately, including referrals to federal oversight and press freedom organizations if necessary.
This measure is not adversarial in nature but protective, due to demonstrated patterns of retaliation, dishonesty, and gaslighting by several of the named parties and affiliated institutions. Public visibility ensures safety and accuracy and is being pursued in good faith.
VII. MOTION TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE OF BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE FROM OLATHE POLICE DEPARTMENT
COMES NOW, Petitioner Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for an order compelling the immediate release of all body-worn camera footage, call logs, and incident reports from the Olathe Police Department involving interactions between the Department and the undersigned, or concerning Christ Connect Church, for the period covering the last six (6) months. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:
Relevant Background and Investigatory Activity
 Petitioner has been engaged in lawful private investigation into systemic coercive control, defamation, tortious interference, and coordinated abuse involving multiple named defendants who are closely and publicly affiliated with Christ Connect Church in Olathe, Kansas. Surveillance, statements, and social media evidence suggest an ongoing pattern of obstruction, conspiracy, and retaliation coordinated through said church and aided by improper shielding from accountability.
Police Involvement and Withheld Footage
 On or about [insert known incident date if available], Petitioner was approached by Olathe Police officers at or near Christ Connect Church. Officers claimed authority based on unverified allegations, yet no formal service, citation, or criminal charge was provided. Petitioner was told to vacate the premises under threat of trespass despite no legal grounds or notice. When a lawful subpoena for the related body cam footage and dashcam video was issued, the request was improperly denied on the grounds that it would “interfere with the church.”
Improper Invocation of Exemptions
 The refusal to release footage under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA) violates the statutory presumption in favor of transparency and amounts to obstruction of ongoing civil litigation. There is no applicable exemption that protects a religious organization from public accountability when its agents engage law enforcement to intimidate, mislead, or deter the exercise of legal rights.
Urgency and Spoliation Risk
 Due to ongoing concealment of evidence, credible reports of coordinated deletion of texts and documents by parties affiliated with Christ Connect Church, and the mobility of the defendants who appear to be fleeing service, there is immediate risk of spoliation. Delay in accessing the footage threatens irreparable harm to the integrity of discovery, and continued refusal may constitute deliberate obstruction.
Public Transparency and First Amendment Protections
 Petitioner asserts his First Amendment right to document and publish all proceedings, evidence, and government interactions related to this case. Any attempt to silence, intimidate, or deny access to public records—especially those used to protect or conceal civil wrongdoing—will be treated as obstruction and a violation of federal civil rights. The footage in question concerns a matter of broad public concern, including religious abuse of power, coordinated reputational harm, and systemic judicial interference.
VIII. MOTION FOR ALTERNATIVE SERVICE AND SERVICE BY PUBLICATION
COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pursuant to K.S.A. 60-307 and K.S.A. 60-313, and respectfully moves this Court to authorize alternative service and service by publication for the above-captioned action, and in support thereof states as follows:
Evidence of Evasion and Coordinated Obstruction
 Defendants are known to attend Christ Connect Church, a location where Plaintiff was unlawfully threatened with trespass by Olathe Police after attempting to effectuate lawful service. Despite no criminal action or citation, law enforcement refused to produce body cam footage under subpoena, citing protections for the church, thereby confirming deliberate obstruction and complicity in service evasion.
Known Social Media, Email, and Community Presence
 Plaintiff can confirm that Defendants maintain active accounts on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, and that their activities continue publicly through local employment, religious affiliation, and family networks in Wyandotte County and surrounding areas. Multiple parties have been seen vacationing, suggesting they are actively avoiding jurisdiction.
Proposed Alternative Methods
 Plaintiff now seeks authorization to serve Defendants through the following means, all of which are reasonably calculated to provide actual notice:


Direct message on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn
Emails to last known addresses
Public notice in the Wyandotte Daily News, KCUR classifieds, and Google Ads (geofenced to Wyandotte County)
Posting flyers near Christ Connect Church and their last known residences
Publishing the petition and summons on a public case-tracking website hosted by the Plaintiff
Paid social media advertising tagged to known associates


Legal Basis and Precedent
 Under K.S.A. 60-307 and Rule 4(e), courts may approve alternative service where personal service is impracticable, and publication under K.S.A. 60-313 is appropriate when residence is unknown or evaded. Given the deliberate efforts to obstruct, Plaintiff's request meets all statutory requirements.
IX. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
Accept this Petition for filing and permit full discovery under K.S.A. §§ 60-226 to 60-245;
Issue subpoenas to preserve and obtain digital communications between Defendants;
Order Defendants and their counsel to respond to prior communications regarding these claims or face sanctions;
Permit Plaintiff to amend the Petition post-discovery for formal class certification under K.S.A. § 60-223;
Order the immediate release of all body-worn and dash camera footage from the Olathe Police Department involving Christ Connect Church and Micheal Lawrence Salmon for the past six (6) months,
Compel the production of any call logs, written reports, or internal communications referencing said incidents,
Approve alternative service by the methods listed above, Consider service complete upon Plaintiff filing an affidavit detailing efforts and publication reach;
And grant any other relief this Court deems just and proper.`

  type: "Motion",
  status: "Granted",
  content: `Comes now, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to compel the Clerk’s Office to fulfill its ministerial duties, pursuant to applicable state law and constitutional guarantees of access to the courts. In support of this Motion, I state the following:
On_______________ I personally appeared at the Clerk’s Office for the purpose of performing procedural tasks required in preparation for lawful discovery, including but not limited to:
Requesting a blank subpoena form;
Filing or timestamping of case documents;
Accessing or reviewing court records.
These procedural tools are not optional but are essential to the exercise of my due process rights as a pro se litigant preparing for hearings and conducting discovery.
I was either denied access, redirected without explanation, or coerced into using forms that are not legally required under Wyandotte County procedural rules or Supreme Court Rule 111, which allows for written pleadings.
As a result, I was forced to spend unnecessary time and labor navigating administrative obstruction, all of which is being documented for federal claims involving denial of access, obstruction of due process, and coercive policies applied unequally to self-represented litigants.
This Motion is submitted to preserve the record, request judicial intervention, and serve notice of damages incurred.

 Time Spent: ____________________
 Staff Involved (if known): ____________________
 Action Requested: _______________________________________________
 Outcome / Notes:

WHEREFORE, I respectfully request that the Court:
Issue an order compelling the Clerk’s Office to provide equal access to litigation tools;
Declare that forcing use of pre-selected forms, when proper motions are filed, is not supported by rule or statute;
Enter this Motion on the docket to preserve the timeline and financial harm incurred from ongoing obstruction, and refrain from further obfuscation.`

  type: "Motion",
  status: "Granted",
  content: `COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to compel the Civil Clerk’s Office of this District to fulfill its ministerial duty under K.S.A. 60-245 by issuing and signing subpoenas submitted in good faith for purposes of pretrial discovery. In support of this Motion, Plaintiff states as follows:
STATEMENT OF FACTS:
Plaintiff is a pro se party in the above-captioned civil case, properly filed and pending in Wyandotte County District Court.
On or about [insert date of visit], Plaintiff appeared in person at the Civil Clerk’s Office to request subpoenas duces tecum in connection with discovery efforts, pursuant to K.S.A. 60-245 and relevant Kansas Rules of Civil Procedure.
The Clerk’s Office declined or delayed issuance of said subpoenas, despite the fact that:
Plaintiff provided a valid case number (25CV325),
The subpoenas were properly formatted or requested for pro se use,
The Kansas Code does not require legal representation to access discovery tools
LEGAL BASIS:
Under K.S.A. 60-245, subpoenas may be issued “by the clerk under the seal of the court or by an attorney as an officer of the court.”
As a pro se litigant, Plaintiff is entitled to utilize the Clerk's signature and seal in place of an attorney’s.
The Clerk’s refusal to issue subpoenas obstructs Plaintiff’s access to evidence and impairs the discovery process, which is protected under the Due Process Clauses of the Kansas Constitution and the U.S. Constitution.
DEMAND:
Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
Issue an Order to the Clerk instructing them to issue, sign, and seal subpoenas upon request by a pro se litigant in an active civil case; Confirm that pro se parties are entitled to use subpoenas as authorized under Kansas law without further gatekeeping or unnecessary delays; Waive any ambiguity or non-statutory policy blocking discovery access for parties without counsel.
To deny the undersigned access to court-issued subpoenas is to deny meaningful participation in civil litigation. No statutory basis exists for such obstruction. Plaintiff therefore asks the Court to enforce its own rules and issue relief as outlined above.`

  id: "2025CV325",
  title: "MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PRODUCE SURVEILLANCE AND BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE",
  date: "2025-05-15",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and hereby moves this Court to preserve and compel production of all surveillance and law enforcement body camera footage from incidents occurring on May 14, 2025, during filing procedures in the above-captioned cases. This footage is critical to evaluating potential violations of civil rights, improper interference with lawful discovery activity, and possible abuse of authority by courthouse officials and law enforcement personnel.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 14, 2025, Movant lawfully appeared at the Wyandotte County courthouse to file and deliver subpoenas tied to lawful discovery under open litigation in three matters. Court clerks at the civil filings window refused to process standard subpoena filings without justification, withheld procedural forms, and issued contradictory directives in what appeared to be a coordinated obstruction.
When Movant asked for clarification on how to escalate the issue, the clerks summoned an armed sheriff's deputy to the scene. The deputy did not de-escalate but rather aggravated the situation, spoke over legal questions, and attempted to dismiss Movant from a public records window. Upon learning that his conduct and identity would be included in a records request, the officer visibly and audibly turned off his body-worn camera mid-incident.
Movant has reason to believe this was not an isolated event but part of a pattern of retaliatory obstruction toward litigants pursuing subpoena enforcement, civil rights claims, or other discovery unfavorable to courthouse personnel or their associates. These events raise serious concerns regarding the clerk’s impartiality and whether court personnel are enlisting law enforcement to intimidate or suppress legal access for disfavored parties.
LEGAL BASIS
Under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., all body-worn and security camera footage recorded in public spaces by public officials is subject to disclosure and preservation. Further, under the Kansas Judicial Code of Conduct and applicable civil rights protections, clerks and judicial officers may not engage in retaliatory obstruction of access to courts or use law enforcement to discourage legal activity protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
This Court retains both statutory and inherent authority to order immediate preservation of material evidence where misconduct may be involved, especially when state actors use administrative power to interfere with due process and discovery rights.
REQUESTED RELIEF
Movant respectfully requests:
That the Court issue an immediate preservation order for all audio, video, and surveillance footage from the Wyandotte County courthouse on May 14, 2025, covering the time period between 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM.
That this order include:
Courthouse security camera footage showing civil clerk interactions
All body camera footage worn by the sheriff deputy who interacted with Movant
Any internal courthouse communications logs, radio transmissions, or dispatch records relevant to the clerk's request for police presence
Any video/audio showing the moment the officer deactivated his body camera
That the Court compel the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office and courthouse security division to produce the unredacted footage either:
Directly to Movant;
To the Court for in-camera review; or
Under seal and subject to protective order if privacy concerns arise.
That the Court formally record this request in the docket of each related case to preserve procedural integrity and guard against evidence spoliation, especially given the ongoing pattern of retaliation against Movant for exercising protected legal actions.`

  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and hereby petitions this Court to compel the Civil Division and Special Actions Division of the Wyandotte County Courthouse to accept properly submitted subpoenas duces tecum, and to preserve all associated surveillance and law enforcement body camera footage tied to the obstruction and police removal of the Petitioner on May 16, 2025.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 16, 2025, Petitioner attempted to submit a subpoena duces tecum to the Civil and Special Actions Divisions. Clerks were unable to distinguish between a subpoena ad testificatum and a subpoena duces tecum, incorrectly asserting that only one form was available. Petitioner clarified the legal distinction, but clerks refused to accept the submission and directed him to the Self-Help Center, which also issued the wrong form. Upon Petitioner’s attempt to educate the clerks and assert his right to submit the correct form, courthouse staff called law enforcement to remove him. Petitioner remained calm, was the only person present in the room, and did not raise his voice. His removal from the courthouse constituted a retaliatory action against lawful court access and First Amendment-protected conduct.
LEGAL BASIS
The refusal to accept a valid subpoena duces tecum violates procedural due process, impedes discovery, and obstructs the court’s own administrative integrity. Under Kansas law and the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), the public has the right to access records and to file lawful legal instruments. The clerk’s ignorance of basic subpoena forms and subsequent retaliatory involvement of law enforcement to remove a peaceful pro se litigant constitutes an abuse of discretion and a chilling violation of constitutional rights.

REQUESTED RELIEF
That the Court issue an order compelling all relevant court divisions to accept subpoenas duces tecum properly formatted and submitted by the Petitioner.
That the Court issue an order preserving all surveillance footage and audio from the Civil and Special Actions Divisions on May 16, 2025 (8:00 AM – 1:00 PM).
That the Court issue an order compelling the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office to preserve and produce body camera footage of officers who interacted with the Petitioner on May 16, 2025.
That the Court document this event on the official record for all relevant case dockets to protect against future obstruction or retaliation.
That the Court admonish or require remedial training for court clerks involved in the incident to prevent recurrences.`

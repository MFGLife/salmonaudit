      title: "Motion for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, with Notice of Anticipated Class Certification Following Discovery",
      date: "2025-04-22",
      type: "Motion",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `COMES NOW Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon (“Plaintiff”), pursuant to K.S.A. § 60-223 and
    Rule 23 of the Kansas Rules of Civil Procedure, and respectfully moves this Court to certify this
    matter as a class action and grant declaratory and injunctive relief as follows:
    I. INTRODUCTION
    This action arises from the systematic, unauthorized, and procedurally unlawful conduct of The
    Layne Project, Inc.—a third-party entity repeatedly empowered by Kansas courts without
    adequate oversight, transparency, or legal foundation. The Layne Project acted without
    Plaintiff’s consent, outside judicial order, and against explicit, on-record objections. These
    actions caused measurable harm to Plaintiff and, based on extensive research and
    correspondence, a substantial number of similarly situated parents across Kansas.
    In addition, the involvement of outside actors, churches, and witness networks connected to
    court activity—specifically Christ Connect Church and individuals operating under religious or
    informal authority—has led to an expanded pattern of coordinated misconduct.
    This case addresses institutional collusion, witness manipulation, due process violations, and
    covert communication pipelines between unregulated entities and judicial actors—all shielded
    from public scrutiny.
    II. CLASS ACTION CRITERIA
    
    Page 1 of 7
    
    Plaintiff seeks certification on behalf of all persons within Kansas who, within the last five years:
    ● Were referred to The Layne Project for supervised visitation, parenting services, or
    custody-related evaluations without opportunity to formally object or without transparent
    documentation of referral;
    ● Were subjected to undisclosed, unilateral communication between The Layne Project
    and judicial actors without notice or consent;
    ● Were subjected to inconsistent and opaque financial practices that masked eligibility for
    fee waivers or falsely imposed financial obligations;
    ● Were subjected to non-governmental surveillance, uncredentialed observation, or
    informal church-backed “testimony” presented under the guise of moral authority;
    ● Suffered procedural, financial, and familial harm as a result of The Layne Project’s
    unauthorized role in judicial proceedings and its referral partnerships with informal
    institutions and personal contacts of the involved parties.
    
    The proposed class satisfies the requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and
    adequacy as detailed under K.S.A. § 60-223.
    III. STATEMENT OF FACTS
    A. Unauthorized Judicial Influence
    Without court order or Plaintiff’s consent, The Layne Project inserted itself into active litigation
    involving Plaintiff’s parental rights. It communicated directly with the court behind closed doors,
    influencing orders and recommendations while Plaintiff's timely objections were ignored or
    omitted from the record.
    B. Subpoena Stonewalled
    Plaintiff submitted multiple formal motions for subpoenas to uncover communications and
    procedural corruption tied to The Layne Project, Joshua Garrett, Kelly Truelove, and associated
    third parties. These requests remain unaddressed or delayed under vague procedural
    justifications, exposing systemic avoidance tactics.
    C. Collusion with Christ Connect Church and Improper Witness Behavior
    Members of Christ Connect Church, specifically Natasha and Robert Kluttz, submitted witness
    statements admitting to "monitoring" Plaintiff’s behavior without formal licensing or
    appointment. These statements were used in court to support claims of instability, while their
    association with referral relationships to The Layne Project remains undisclosed. Plaintiff’s
    own mother, Carolyn Salmon, has coordinated behind the scenes to support this narrative and
    facilitate church-based involvement in legal matters under the pretense of moral oversight.
    D. False Financial Barriers
    The Layne Project initially denied services absent full payment. Later, it was revealed—only after
    
    Page 2 of 7
    
    persistent inquiry—that fee waivers were available but withheld until arbitrary documentation
    was submitted. This misrepresentation directly interfered with Plaintiff’s right to visitation.
    E. Pattern of Obstruction
    Over a three-month period, The Layne Project refused to produce policies, communication
    records, or any documents related to their handling of Plaintiff’s case. Meanwhile, associated
    parties provided court with selective witness statements meant to simulate credibility while
    withholding context, personal connections, and conflicts of interest.
    IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF
    Plaintiff satisfies all criteria for class certification under K.S.A. § 60-223 and seeks equitable
    relief under Kansas civil procedure and constitutional doctrine. The harms in this case are not
    isolated—they are institutionalized, recurring, and designed to undermine due process through
    informal influence and procedural opacity.
    Numerosity: Hundreds of Kansas families are estimated to be affected annually.
    Commonality: Core legal issues arise from shared fact patterns.
    Typicality: Plaintiff’s experience mirrors that of many other victims of The Layne Project’s
    interference.
    Adequacy: Plaintiff has created a public-facing, transparent legal archive and audit system to
    ensure full class participation and documentation:
    V. RELIEF REQUESTED
    Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
    1. Certify this matter as a class action under K.S.A. § 60-223;
    2. Order The Layne Project and any associated institutions, including Christ Connect
    Church, to produce all communications related to case referrals, surveillance, witness
    coaching, or financial transactions;
    3. Declare that The Layne Project’s conduct, and the use of informal, uncredentialed
    witness participation coordinated through religious or private community institutions,
    violates Kansas due process protections;
    4. Enjoin The Layne Project and any partner institutions from participating in any legal
    matter involving Kansas families without:
    ○ Prior consent from both parties;
    ○ Transparent referral agreements;
    ○ Disclosure of all affiliations and conflicts;
    5. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper, including the preservation
    of whistleblower protection for future class members coming forward.

    NOTICE OF PATTERNED ENTERPRISE ACTIVITY INVOKING RICO
    STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
    COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully submits this
    supplemental motion in connection with the pending class action, to provide notice of the
    existence of a broader, structured pattern of misconduct consistent with the federal standards
    outlined in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§
    1961–1968.
    This supplemental notice is not a full RICO filing at this time but is provided for the Court’s
    awareness and possible future severance or referral to appropriate jurisdiction.
    I. BACKGROUND AND ENTERPRISE ELEMENTS
    Plaintiff has identified conduct across multiple actors which—when considered
    together—suggest the existence of a coordinated enterprise acting in a manner consistent with
    RICO's definition of an "association-in-fact" enterprise. This includes:
    ● The Layne Project, Inc., operating without transparency or oversight while coordinating
    ex parte with courts and family law attorneys;
    ● Crycella and Amanda Freitag, Stephanie Reed, Tyler Brown; police and court
    manipulation, kidnapping, perjury
    ● Joshua Garrett, attorney of record for the opposing party, shown to have direct referral
    and coordination ties with The Layne Project and non-legal actors;
    ● Natasha and Robert Kluttz, witnesses affiliated with Christ Connect Church, submitting
    extrajudicial surveillance testimony under religious or social cover;
    ● Carolyn Salmon, a close family member and silent actor whose role in facilitating
    improper contact, witness support, and moral framing remains ongoing and
    undocumented;
    ● Christ Connect Church, an entity which has maintained informal referral ties with Layne
    Project personnel and whose members act as unlicensed observers in custody cases.
    II. RICO RELEVANCE
    The structural, ongoing nature of these relationships satisfies the threshold for enterprise under
    RICO and introduces the possibility of:
    ● Witness tampering (18 U.S.C. § 1512)
    ● Obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503)
    ● Wire fraud via false affidavits and financial misrepresentations (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
    
    Page 4 of 7
    
    ● Extortion of parental rights via controlled access and manipulation of supervised
    visitation (18 U.S.C. § 1951)
    III. REQUEST FOR SEVERABLE RECOGNITION
    Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court acknowledge this supplemental filing as a stand-alone
    motion for future severance, referral, or expansion. This is not intended to alter the main class
    action framework but to preserve the record in anticipation of expanded relief being sought in
    either civil or federal court.
    WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Court:
    1. Accept this supplemental filing as judicial notice of an ongoing patterned enterprise;
    2. Permit severance of this issue if deemed prejudicial to the central class action matter;
    3. Allow discovery related to these individuals and entities to proceed under the RICO
    relevance standard;
    4. Provide any other relief the Court deems just and proper in light of this emergent
    structural pattern.
    
    MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PUBLICLY DISCLOSE SYSTEMIC
    CONFLICT NETWORKS
    COMES NOW Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court for a standing order
    requiring all named and involved entities—including public witnesses, court contractors, referral
    partners, and their associated religious or business organizations—to preserve and disclose any
    relationships that may constitute conflict of interest networks related to The Layne Project or
    custody-related case referrals over the last five (5) years.
    This motion also seeks judicial permission to maintain and publish a structured,
    non-confidential record of such networks for public and legal review under public accountability
    and transparency principles.
    I. BASIS FOR MOTION
    Plaintiff has uncovered and cataloged extensive overlap between personal, religious, and
    professional affiliations of parties testifying or influencing court activity, particularly:
    ● Church organizations (e.g., Christ Connect Church) submitting informal witness
    declarations tied to court influence;
    ● Undisclosed business relationships between said churches and The Layne Project;
    
    Page 5 of 7
    
    ● Personal coordination between witnesses (e.g., Natasha and Robert Kluttz), court
    officers, and therapists involved in custody assessments;
    ● Family-based suppression and triangulation, including the concealed role of Plaintiff’s
    mother, Carolyn Salmon, in guiding or manipulating narratives behind the scenes.
    II. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
    Plaintiff requests the Court:
    1. Order the preservation of communications and affiliations between witnesses, court
    officers, and religious or private organizations that have submitted information or had
    contact with this case;
    2. Permit the maintenance of a publicly viewable, evidence-based registry of witness
    affiliations and connections, which will be hosted at: https://salmonaudit.info/
    3. Recognize this preservation request as a proactive shield against future denial of
    coordination, tampering, or influence laundering across legal, social, and spiritual lines;
    4. Allow Plaintiff to continue organizing submissions from others affected by these referral
    and witness systems, as part of a broader pattern of court manipulation.
    III. WHY THIS MATTERS
    This motion is about prophylactic transparency. It gives the Court a choice:
    Either acknowledge the existence of improper relationships now,
    or face their exposure later—when it’s too late to act without consequence.
    If the parties involved have nothing to hide, they will comply.
    If not, their silence becomes evidentiary.
    WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an order compelling the above,
    and granting such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

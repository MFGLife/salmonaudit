      type: "Motion",
      status: "OverRuled",
      content: `TO THE HONORABLE COURT:\r\nI, Micheal Salmon, appearing Pro Se, respectfully move this Court to transfer venue for this\r\ncase from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience\r\nof all parties and witnesses, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a).\r\n\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis motion seeks to transfer venue to the District of Kansas, where both parties currently\r\nreside, to reduce undue burdens on the parties and ensure efficient resolution of this matter.\r\nThe current venue in Missouri imposes significant logistical and financial challenges, making it\r\nimpractical for the parties and witnesses.\r\n\r\nII. Factual Background\r\n1. Parties� Residences:\r\n? I, Micheal Salmon, reside at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas, 66103.\r\n? The Plaintiff, Crycella Freitag, resides in Pomona, Kansas.\r\n2. Current Venue Impact:\r\n? The current venue in Missouri is over four hours away from both parties� homes,\r\nmaking travel difficult.\r\n3. Efforts to Cooperate:\r\n? I relocated from Missouri to Kansas to facilitate co-parenting and reduce travel\r\nburdens, moving within 40 minutes of the Plaintiff.\r\n\r\n4. Personal and Community Ties in Kansas:\r\n? Our two-year-old son, Felix, attends a Montessori school and is actively involved\r\nin community activities in Kansas, including church and friendships.\r\n\r\n? Both families reside in Kansas, making it a more practical location for witness\r\ntestimonies.\r\n\r\n5. Financial and Work Constraints:\r\n? As a full-time single father, taking time off work to travel four hours each way for\r\ncourt proceedings is unfeasible.\r\n? The Plaintiff also works full time, making a Missouri venue equally burdensome.\r\n\r\nIII. Legal Standard\r\nUnder 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a), this Court may transfer a case for the convenience of the parties\r\nand witnesses, and in the interest of justice. Factors to consider include:\r\n1. The convenience of the parties and witnesses;\r\n2. Access to sources of proof;\r\n3. The plaintiff�s choice of forum;\r\n4. Practical challenges of conducting the trial in the chosen forum;\r\n5. Local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\r\n\r\nIV. Argument\r\n1. Convenience of the Parties:\r\n? Both parties reside in Kansas and would face significant hardship traveling to\r\nMissouri for court appearances. Transferring the case to Kansas reduces\r\nlogistical burdens for both.\r\n2. Convenience of Witnesses:\r\n? Both parties� families and potential witnesses reside in Kansas, minimizing travel\r\nfor them and ensuring better participation.\r\n\r\n3. Access to Evidence:\r\n? Relevant evidence, such as Felix�s school records and community ties, is more\r\nreadily available in Kansas.\r\n\r\n4. Local Interest:\r\n? Kansas has a strong local interest in adjudicating this matter, as both parties and\r\ntheir child reside and participate in the Kansas community.\r\n\r\n5. Interest of Justice:\r\n\r\n? Transferring the case aligns with fairness, reduces financial and logistical\r\nhardships, and supports the co-parenting relationship.\r\n\r\nV. Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons stated, I, Micheal Salmon, respectfully request that this Court transfer venue of\r\nthis case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice\r\nand for the convenience of the parties and witnesses.`

      date: "2025-04-17",
      type: "Motion",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY CUSTODY AND EX PARTE RELIEF
    I. EMERGENCY BASIS
    1. Petitioner respectfully moves this Court to grant temporary sole legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon, age 2, on an emergency basis.
    2. The child is currently suffering from daily untreated allergic reactions, presenting in the form of coughing, congestion, and respiratory distress.
    3. The mother, Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, has refused to take Felix to an allergist or seek treatment, despite repeated symptoms and parental requests, constituting ongoing medical neglect.
    4. Crycella has demonstrated a pattern of abuse, interference, and contempt of court, including but not limited to:
    Attempting to abduct Felix in June 2024 and calling the police to enforce an unlawful relocation to Kansas, directly violating the court’s jurisdiction and parental agreements.
    Willfully destroying and interfering with Felix’s communication with Petitioner by refusing all contact, confiscating devices, and failing to honor phone time—despite Petitioner allowing Felix free and unrestricted access to a phone and tablet.
    Ignoring multiple court orders without consequence, including orders regarding custody, communication, and medical care, while the court has failed to act—raising serious concerns of racial bias and systemic neglect of due process.
    5. Crycella has also exposed Felix to unsanitary and unsafe living conditions (previously documented in filings and hearings), and cold weather without appropriate clothing or shelter, directly contributing to his respiratory symptoms and physical discomfort. These repeated actions reflect a proven and escalating disregard for Felix’s health, safety, and well-being. Petitioner believes immediate intervention is necessary to prevent further harm.
    II. JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT
    Felix has resided in Kansas for 25 out of the past 29 months.
    The Missouri court (Stone County Case No. 24SN-DR00104) has not issued a valid custody order.
    The Missouri judge, Matt Alan Selby, stated on the record, “It’s getting close to the six-month rule, and I’m planning on dismissing.”
    The Missouri court has also:
    Ignored timely emergency motions in violation of published Motion Day rules.
    Failed to appoint a functioning Guardian ad Litem; Brook Gipson was named but has never made contact, has no record on Missouri Case.net, and is believed to be a phantom appointee used to mislead Petitioner.
    Permitted the opposing counsel to misrepresent facts and stall proceedings, as documented via communication with Ozarks Law Firm and Rooney McBride & Smith.
    Petitioner has filed an appeal in Missouri, removing jurisdiction from the trial court. (Southern Court of Appeals Case No. SD38905)
    Missouri is therefore an inconvenient and improper forum, and Kansas is the child’s true home state under the UCCJEA.
    III. REQUESTED ORDERS
    Petitioner requests the following relief:
    Grant temporary sole legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon to Petitioner.
    Issue an Emergency Ex Parte Order barring the mother from removing Felix from Kansas without court permission.
    Grant temporary visitation to the mother: four (4) hours weekly, unsupervised.
    Issue an order prohibiting interference with Petitioner’s parenting time, communication, and ability to seek medical care.
    Set a hearing for full custody determination at the Court’s earliest availability.
    IV. RELEVANT CONDUCT & UNRESPONSIVE COURT
    The mother has weaponized legal processes to obstruct access to Felix, including refusal to comply with visitation facilitation efforts and false claims of housing instability that have since been disproven.
    The Missouri judge has repeatedly refused to hear or rule on emergency filings, even those supported by evidence of harm to the child.
    Additionally, the visitation facility KidCentric cited in court records appears to be a nonexistent or fraudulent entity, with no actual ability to provide services, further undermining court credibility.
    V. FRAUDULENT REPRESENTATIONS & LIABILITY NOTICE
    Petitioner will pursue discovery and subpoena in future filings to investigate whether the Guardian ad Litem appointment was fraudulent, and whether Rooney McBride & Smith and Ozarks Law Firm are complicit in fabricating court compliance.
    Petitioner believes the Missouri court is intentionally stalling until (May 2nd) to dismiss the case under false pretenses.
    This Court is now the only venue positioned to protect the child.
    VI. NOTICE OF PARALLEL ACTION AND RESERVED RIGHTS
    Petitioner has initiated this emergency action in Kansas and expressly reserves the right to use any evidence or proceedings from Missouri in this or future legal actions.
    No findings or dismissals from Missouri—especially those issued under appeal, by a biased court, or without jurisdiction—shall be used to prejudice this Kansas proceeding or to limit Petitioner’s rights.
    Missouri has no authority to interfere with Kansas jurisdiction, and Petitioner requests this Court formally acknowledge Kansas as the child’s proper legal forum.
    
    DESIGNATION OF NEXT FRIEND
    Comes now, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully enters this action as the natural father and Next Friend of Felix Day Salmon, a minor child, for the purpose of pursuing legal remedies and protections in his best interests.
    
    MOTION TO FILE ELECTRONICALLY
    In support of this Motion, Petitioner states as follows:
    The Kansas Supreme Court Rules permit electronic filing of pleadings by self-represented litigants where such systems are in place.
    The undersigned is a pro se litigant and has access to the necessary technology to file electronically.
    Electronic filing will promote judicial efficiency, reduce unnecessary delay, and ensure timely access to the court by all parties.
    WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order allowing him to file pleadings electronically in this matter, and for such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

      date: "2025-05-02",
      type: "Petition",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `PETITION FOR IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO MINOR CHILD AND REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY HEARING
    COMES NOW the Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, biological father of Felix Day Salmon, and respectfully requests this Court to immediately grant temporary custodial access and set an emergency hearing regarding the welfare of the minor child, Felix Day Salmon. Petitioner has been denied all contact with his son for over three months due to a combination of jurisdictional confusion and procedural failures in an out-of-state proceeding. The result has caused severe emotional harm to both father and child and continues to violate Petitioner’s fundamental parental rights.
    Petitioner respectfully recommends the Court schedule an immediate hearing to award him at least one month of uninterrupted custodial time as a temporary, make-up period for the extensive and unjustified denial of access. Following this, Petitioner requests a fair and full evidentiary hearing to address all matters properly under Kansas jurisdiction. At the previous Missouri hearing, the Petitioner voluntarily produced all financial records, communication logs, and phone data, while the opposing party produced no evidence and was not held to any reciprocal standard. The result was a lopsided proceeding in which no factual rebuttal was considered.
    This Court has both the authority and the responsibility to intervene in the best interests of the child and to correct the procedural imbalance that has thus far deprived both child and father of their right to maintain their familial bond.
    This Court has proper jurisdiction under K.S.A. § 23-37, as both the minor child, Felix Day Salmon, and both parents currently reside within the State of Kansas. Any temporary relocation to Missouri was both recent and not made in good faith, as Respondent had expressed her intention to return Felix to Stone County, Missouri just weeks before the six-month statutory residency mark, suggesting the move was strategic rather than child-centered. (See Audit #ex.35.6)
    Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, has formally removed himself from the Missouri docket and is requesting Kansas assume full jurisdiction over all matters concerning Felix’s welfare. This petition is filed in good faith and in accordance with Kansas law, seeking immediate and corrective relief after multiple procedural injustices in Missouri proceedings.
    Critically, Respondent Crycella Freitag made no mention of the ongoing and complete denial of access between Felix and his father in her latest filings, choosing instead to focus her efforts entirely on forum control and jurisdictional maneuvering. This demonstrates a clear attempt to evade scrutiny and obstruct the fair resolution of custody and parenting time, rather than prioritize Felix’s best interests.
    Petitioner affirms that this is the proper venue for addressing these matters and that an emergency hearing is both necessary and legally appropriate to prevent further emotional harm to the child and irreparable erosion of the parent-child relationship. A competent and impartial court acting in the best interests of the child would proceed as follows:
    Grant the Petitioner immediate make-up custodial time with Felix while the facts and evidence are properly reviewed;
    Schedule a neutral evidentiary hearing in Kansas.
    This structure provides both parties a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate what sole custody looks like under their care, with the child’s well-being as the central focus. No Guardian ad Litem is needed; the parties are prepared to present direct evidence. What is required now is judicial intervention that prioritizes equity, transparency, and the child’s right to family continuity—values this Petition brings before this Court.
    Attached to this Petition are complete, unedited recordings of the last three Missouri hearings for the Court’s reference. Petitioner requests access to the audio copies submitted by Respondent in order to verify their integrity, given a history of misrepresentation in the record.

  title: "MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PRODUCE SURVEILLANCE AND BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE",
  date: "2025-05-15",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and hereby moves this Court to preserve and compel production of all surveillance and law enforcement body camera footage from incidents occurring on May 14, 2025, during filing procedures in the above-captioned cases. This footage is critical to evaluating potential violations of civil rights, improper interference with lawful discovery activity, and possible abuse of authority by courthouse officials and law enforcement personnel.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 14, 2025, Movant lawfully appeared at the Wyandotte County courthouse to file and deliver subpoenas tied to lawful discovery under open litigation in three matters. Court clerks at the civil filings window refused to process standard subpoena filings without justification, withheld procedural forms, and issued contradictory directives in what appeared to be a coordinated obstruction.
When Movant asked for clarification on how to escalate the issue, the clerks summoned an armed sheriff's deputy to the scene. The deputy did not de-escalate but rather aggravated the situation, spoke over legal questions, and attempted to dismiss Movant from a public records window. Upon learning that his conduct and identity would be included in a records request, the officer visibly and audibly turned off his body-worn camera mid-incident.
Movant has reason to believe this was not an isolated event but part of a pattern of retaliatory obstruction toward litigants pursuing subpoena enforcement, civil rights claims, or other discovery unfavorable to courthouse personnel or their associates. These events raise serious concerns regarding the clerk’s impartiality and whether court personnel are enlisting law enforcement to intimidate or suppress legal access for disfavored parties.
LEGAL BASIS
Under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., all body-worn and security camera footage recorded in public spaces by public officials is subject to disclosure and preservation. Further, under the Kansas Judicial Code of Conduct and applicable civil rights protections, clerks and judicial officers may not engage in retaliatory obstruction of access to courts or use law enforcement to discourage legal activity protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
This Court retains both statutory and inherent authority to order immediate preservation of material evidence where misconduct may be involved, especially when state actors use administrative power to interfere with due process and discovery rights.
REQUESTED RELIEF
Movant respectfully requests:
That the Court issue an immediate preservation order for all audio, video, and surveillance footage from the Wyandotte County courthouse on May 14, 2025, covering the time period between 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM.
That this order include:
Courthouse security camera footage showing civil clerk interactions
All body camera footage worn by the sheriff deputy who interacted with Movant
Any internal courthouse communications logs, radio transmissions, or dispatch records relevant to the clerk's request for police presence
Any video/audio showing the moment the officer deactivated his body camera
That the Court compel the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office and courthouse security division to produce the unredacted footage either:
Directly to Movant;
To the Court for in-camera review; or
Under seal and subject to protective order if privacy concerns arise.
That the Court formally record this request in the docket of each related case to preserve procedural integrity and guard against evidence spoliation, especially given the ongoing pattern of retaliation against Movant for exercising protected legal actions.`

  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to compel the Clerk’s Office to fulfill its ministerial duties pursuant to applicable state law and constitutional guarantees of access to the courts. In support of this Motion, I state the following:
On May 16, 2025, I personally appeared at the Clerk’s Office for the purpose of performing procedural tasks required in preparation for lawful discovery, including but not limited to:
Requesting a blank subpoena form;
Filing or timestamping of case documents;
Accessing or reviewing court records.
These procedural tools are not optional but are essential to the exercise of my due process rights as a pro se litigant preparing for hearings and conducting discovery.
I was either denied access, redirected without explanation, or coerced into using forms that are not legally required under Wyandotte County procedural rules or Kansas Supreme Court Rule 111, which allows for written pleadings.
As a result, I was forced to spend unnecessary time and labor navigating administrative obstruction, all of which is being documented for potential federal claims involving denial of access, obstruction of due process, and coercive policies applied unequally to self-represented litigants.
This Motion is submitted to preserve the record, request judicial intervention, and serve notice of damages incurred.
 Time Spent: __1 hour__[Total: $600 @3hrs]
 Staff Involved (if known): Civil Dept, Self Help, Special Actions Clerks
 Action Requested: Seperate my duplicate hearing dates, let me have a Subpoena duces tecum 
 Outcome / Notes: Escorted out by police causing 4 civil rights violations.

WHEREFORE, I respectfully request that the Court:
Issue an order compelling the Clerk’s Office to provide equal access to litigation tools;
Declare that forcing use of pre-selected forms, when proper motions are filed, is not supported by rule or statute;
Enter this Motion on the docket to preserve the timeline and financial harm incurred from ongoing obstruction, and refrain from further obfuscation.`

  type: "Petition",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `VERIFIED PETITION FOR EMERGENCY WRIT AND SANCTIONS
(Due Process Violations, Procedural Manipulation, and Request for Immediate Relief)
COMES NOW the Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for the immediate issuance of an Emergency Writ and Sanctions, on grounds of administrative tampering, judicial misconduct, denial of due process, and obstruction of fundamental access to justice. Petitioner seeks urgent relief to prevent further harm, and in support states the following:

I. PARTIES & JURISDICTION
Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, is the biological father of Felix Day Salmon (DOB: December 20, 2022), and resides at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, KS 66103.
Respondent is the biological mother of Felix and resides at 512 Madison Street, Pomona, KS 66076.
Venue and jurisdiction are proper in Wyandotte County, Kansas pursuant to K.S.A. 23-37,201, as this matter involves parental rights and both parties currently reside in the State of Kansas.

II. DETAILED SUMMARY OF PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES
On the morning of May 21, 2025, Petitioner proactively contacted court staff to verify whether the custody hearing in case 2025-DM781 was still scheduled to occur as planned.
A clerk confirmed that the hearing remained on the schedule. However, Petitioner discovered that the docket entry had been removed from the public-facing court records, creating confusion about its status.
Petitioner requested formal proof of this removal. Adrianne, a court clerk, subsequently provided a screenshot of the internal docket system, which confirmed that the hearing had been removed—contrary to prior assurances by Christina “Tina” Rockley, who explicitly indicated that the hearing would be reinstated.
Petitioner had anticipated this form of administrative sabotage and had preserved a detailed email record of prior confirmations and staff communications. Despite the removal, Petitioner appeared at the Zoom hearing to preserve his rights.
Upon joining the Zoom call, Petitioner attempted to address his custody petition. However, Judge Kathleen Lynch abruptly refused to proceed, citing a purported failure to file a “petition for jurisdiction.”
Petitioner objected on the record, asserting that all required documents had already been submitted in accordance with court rules. Rather than allowing further clarification or argument, Judge Lynch immediately terminated the hearing, cutting off the Zoom session and violating Petitioner’s First Amendment right to be heard and his constitutional right to procedural due process.
Within minutes of this abrupt termination, Petitioner submitted the required jurisdictional petition via both email and fax, and called the clerk’s office to confirm and document this emergency submission.
Simultaneously, Petitioner was required to attend a separate live hearing for a related eviction case (WY2025LM002787) involving co-conspirator Kelly Truelove.
During this hearing, Petitioner encountered additional irregularities:
An unfamiliar judge presided over the matter without any formal introduction or record of substitution.
The proceeding was rushed, suggesting either predetermined intent or an attempt to limit scrutiny.
Petitioner’s filed motions were entirely ignored and no record of their existence was acknowledged on the call.
Various unnamed agents were present, and all recording and first amendment protections were under threat of arrest from six (6) uniformed officers.
These parallel events establish a clear pattern of procedural manipulation, denial of access, and collusion among judicial officers and staff to suppress Petitioner’s lawful attempts to assert parental rights and defend his legal position.

III. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF
Petitioner’s rights to due process, access to courts, and a fair hearing are enshrined in the U.S. Constitution (Amendments I and XIV) and the Kansas Constitution (Bill of Rights §18).
The actions and omissions described above amount to intentional administrative sabotage, obstruction of justice, and judicial misconduct.
Under K.S.A. 60-1501 (Habeas Corpus) and 60-1507 (Post-Conviction Remedies), the Court has full authority to issue writs and impose sanctions in cases where parties are deprived of fundamental rights by unlawful court or government actions.
The failure to provide a public docket, the termination of hearing access without cause, and the refusal to acknowledge motions collectively violate the core tenets of procedural fairness, court transparency, and judicial accountability.

IV. REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY WRIT AND SANCTIONS
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the Court to:
A. Issue an Emergency Writ compelling the Court to restore Petitioner’s right to a meaningful custody hearing without further delay or administrative obstruction;
B. Reinstate all previously scheduled hearings, ensuring they occur on the record, are open to public observation, and are docketed transparently;
C. Direct the Clerk of the Court to produce a full and unredacted docket history, including all administrative alterations, removals, and technical edits since this case was filed;
D. Order all judicial officers and court personnel involved in the removal of Petitioner’s hearing and the interference with his legal access to show cause and justify their actions under oath;

  content: `MOTION TO REOPEN CASE, FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF, AND FOR IMMEDIATE EVIDENTIARY HEARING DUE TO PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS
COMES NOW Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to reopen the above-captioned case, grant emergency relief, and schedule an immediate evidentiary hearing. In support, Petitioner states as follows:
I. GROUNDS
1. Denial of Due Process:
Petitioner was denied notice and an opportunity to be heard as required by the Fourteenth Amendment, Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254; Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank, 339 U.S. 306; and HOKUWA-P001, HOKUWA-P005, HOKUWA-P010, HOKUWA-J007, HOKUWA-J0111.
2. Arbitrary Case Closure:
The case was closed before Petitioner could file an emergency petition, despite clear notice of an ongoing emergency, violating HOKUWA-C001, HOKUWA-C010, and HOKUWA-J0191.
3. Judicial Refusal to Rule and Procedural Runaround:
The presiding judge refused to rule on Petitioner’s original motion, then directed Petitioner to file an emergency petition, only for the case to be closed before the petition could be filed—constituting a forced procedural runaround and denial of access to justice (HOKUWA-J008, HOKUWA-P003, HOKUWA-J022)1.
4. Harm to Parent-Child Relationship:
Petitioner has been deprived of contact with his child for five months, resulting in irreparable harm to the parent-child bond and risk of erroneous deprivation of rights, in violation of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319; HOKUWA-J007, HOKUWA-P0011.
II. REQUESTED RELIEF
Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:
A. Immediately reopen the case and restore the matter to the active docket;
B. Schedule an evidentiary hearing at the earliest possible date to address all outstanding issues, including due process violations and the merits of custody and parenting time;
C. Enter temporary orders for make-up parenting time to compensate for the five months of denied contact and to protect the best interests of the child;
D. Provide a judicial explanation on the record for the closure of the case and refusal to rule on Petitioner’s filings, as required by law and judicial ethics;
E. Order that all future filings from Petitioner be accepted and docketed immediately, with written confirmation from the clerk to prevent further procedural sabotage (HOKUWA-C001, HOKUWA-C010, HOKUWA-C005, HOKUWA-C006)1.
III. LEGAL AUTHORITY AND HOKUWA INDEX CITATIONS
Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (pro se filings must be liberally construed and not dismissed without opportunity to present evidence)
Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (clear and convincing evidence required for parental rights termination)
Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (unwed fathers have a right to a hearing before losing custody)
Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254; Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (due process and right to be heard)
HOKUWA Index:
HOKUWA-C001 (Refusal to accept validly formatted motion or pleading)
HOKUWA-C010 (Refusal to process in forma pauperis applications properly)
HOKUWA-C005, C006 (Tampering with file timestamps, omitting documents from docket)
HOKUWA-J007 (Overruling constitutional rights without lawful justification)
HOKUWA-J008 (Denying self-representation without cause)
HOKUWA-J019 (Harassing or intimidating pro se litigants)
HOKUWA-J022 (Refusing to correct errors once demonstrated on record)
HOKUWA-P001, P003, P005, P010 (Failure to provide notice, ignoring motions, ruling without hearing, preventing introduction of evidence)1.
IV. DEMAND FOR ACCOUNTABILITY
Petitioner hereby demands that the Court and Clerk’s Office:
Explain, on the record, why Petitioner’s emergency petition was not accepted and why the case was closed without review;
Certify that all future filings will be accepted and docketed without delay, and that Petitioner will receive written confirmation of every filing;
Acknowledge that the Court, the presiding judge, and the Clerk’s Office are now formally attached as named parties to the pending federal lawsuit (United States District Court for the District of Kansas, Salmon v. Dupree et al.), and that all further procedural violations will be documented and submitted as evidence of systemic due process deprivation.`

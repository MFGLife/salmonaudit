      type: "Motion",
      status: "OverRuled",
      content: `TO THE HONORABLE COURT:\r\nI, Micheal Salmon, appearing Pro Se, respectfully move this Court to transfer venue for this\r\ncase from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience\r\nof all parties and witnesses, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a).\r\n\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis motion seeks to transfer venue to the District of Kansas, where both parties currently\r\nreside, to reduce undue burdens on the parties and ensure efficient resolution of this matter.\r\nThe current venue in Missouri imposes significant logistical and financial challenges, making it\r\nimpractical for the parties and witnesses.\r\n\r\nII. Factual Background\r\n1. Parties� Residences:\r\n? I, Micheal Salmon, reside at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas, 66103.\r\n? The Plaintiff, Crycella Freitag, resides in Pomona, Kansas.\r\n2. Current Venue Impact:\r\n? The current venue in Missouri is over four hours away from both parties� homes,\r\nmaking travel difficult.\r\n3. Efforts to Cooperate:\r\n? I relocated from Missouri to Kansas to facilitate co-parenting and reduce travel\r\nburdens, moving within 40 minutes of the Plaintiff.\r\n\r\n4. Personal and Community Ties in Kansas:\r\n? Our two-year-old son, Felix, attends a Montessori school and is actively involved\r\nin community activities in Kansas, including church and friendships.\r\n\r\n? Both families reside in Kansas, making it a more practical location for witness\r\ntestimonies.\r\n\r\n5. Financial and Work Constraints:\r\n? As a full-time single father, taking time off work to travel four hours each way for\r\ncourt proceedings is unfeasible.\r\n? The Plaintiff also works full time, making a Missouri venue equally burdensome.\r\n\r\nIII. Legal Standard\r\nUnder 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a), this Court may transfer a case for the convenience of the parties\r\nand witnesses, and in the interest of justice. Factors to consider include:\r\n1. The convenience of the parties and witnesses;\r\n2. Access to sources of proof;\r\n3. The plaintiff�s choice of forum;\r\n4. Practical challenges of conducting the trial in the chosen forum;\r\n5. Local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\r\n\r\nIV. Argument\r\n1. Convenience of the Parties:\r\n? Both parties reside in Kansas and would face significant hardship traveling to\r\nMissouri for court appearances. Transferring the case to Kansas reduces\r\nlogistical burdens for both.\r\n2. Convenience of Witnesses:\r\n? Both parties� families and potential witnesses reside in Kansas, minimizing travel\r\nfor them and ensuring better participation.\r\n\r\n3. Access to Evidence:\r\n? Relevant evidence, such as Felix�s school records and community ties, is more\r\nreadily available in Kansas.\r\n\r\n4. Local Interest:\r\n? Kansas has a strong local interest in adjudicating this matter, as both parties and\r\ntheir child reside and participate in the Kansas community.\r\n\r\n5. Interest of Justice:\r\n\r\n? Transferring the case aligns with fairness, reduces financial and logistical\r\nhardships, and supports the co-parenting relationship.\r\n\r\nV. Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons stated, I, Micheal Salmon, respectfully request that this Court transfer venue of\r\nthis case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice\r\nand for the convenience of the parties and witnesses.`

      title: "EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY CUSTODY AND EX PARTE RELIEF",
      date: "2025-04-17",
      type: "Motion",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY CUSTODY AND EX PARTE RELIEF
    I. EMERGENCY BASIS
    1. Petitioner respectfully moves this Court to grant temporary sole legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon, age 2, on an emergency basis.
    2. The child is currently suffering from daily untreated allergic reactions, presenting in the form of coughing, congestion, and respiratory distress.
    3. The mother, Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, has refused to take Felix to an allergist or seek treatment, despite repeated symptoms and parental requests, constituting ongoing medical neglect.
    4. Crycella has demonstrated a pattern of abuse, interference, and contempt of court, including but not limited to:
    Attempting to abduct Felix in June 2024 and calling the police to enforce an unlawful relocation to Kansas, directly violating the court’s jurisdiction and parental agreements.
    Willfully destroying and interfering with Felix’s communication with Petitioner by refusing all contact, confiscating devices, and failing to honor phone time—despite Petitioner allowing Felix free and unrestricted access to a phone and tablet.
    Ignoring multiple court orders without consequence, including orders regarding custody, communication, and medical care, while the court has failed to act—raising serious concerns of racial bias and systemic neglect of due process.
    5. Crycella has also exposed Felix to unsanitary and unsafe living conditions (previously documented in filings and hearings), and cold weather without appropriate clothing or shelter, directly contributing to his respiratory symptoms and physical discomfort. These repeated actions reflect a proven and escalating disregard for Felix’s health, safety, and well-being. Petitioner believes immediate intervention is necessary to prevent further harm.
    II. JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT
    Felix has resided in Kansas for 25 out of the past 29 months.
    The Missouri court (Stone County Case No. 24SN-DR00104) has not issued a valid custody order.
    The Missouri judge, Matt Alan Selby, stated on the record, “It’s getting close to the six-month rule, and I’m planning on dismissing.”
    The Missouri court has also:
    Ignored timely emergency motions in violation of published Motion Day rules.
    Failed to appoint a functioning Guardian ad Litem; Brook Gipson was named but has never made contact, has no record on Missouri Case.net, and is believed to be a phantom appointee used to mislead Petitioner.
    Permitted the opposing counsel to misrepresent facts and stall proceedings, as documented via communication with Ozarks Law Firm and Rooney McBride & Smith.
    Petitioner has filed an appeal in Missouri, removing jurisdiction from the trial court. (Southern Court of Appeals Case No. SD38905)
    Missouri is therefore an inconvenient and improper forum, and Kansas is the child’s true home state under the UCCJEA.
    III. REQUESTED ORDERS
    Petitioner requests the following relief:
    Grant temporary sole legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon to Petitioner.
    Issue an Emergency Ex Parte Order barring the mother from removing Felix from Kansas without court permission.
    Grant temporary visitation to the mother: four (4) hours weekly, unsupervised.
    Issue an order prohibiting interference with Petitioner’s parenting time, communication, and ability to seek medical care.
    Set a hearing for full custody determination at the Court’s earliest availability.
    IV. RELEVANT CONDUCT & UNRESPONSIVE COURT
    The mother has weaponized legal processes to obstruct access to Felix, including refusal to comply with visitation facilitation efforts and false claims of housing instability that have since been disproven.
    The Missouri judge has repeatedly refused to hear or rule on emergency filings, even those supported by evidence of harm to the child.
    Additionally, the visitation facility KidCentric cited in court records appears to be a nonexistent or fraudulent entity, with no actual ability to provide services, further undermining court credibility.
    V. FRAUDULENT REPRESENTATIONS & LIABILITY NOTICE
    Petitioner will pursue discovery and subpoena in future filings to investigate whether the Guardian ad Litem appointment was fraudulent, and whether Rooney McBride & Smith and Ozarks Law Firm are complicit in fabricating court compliance.
    Petitioner believes the Missouri court is intentionally stalling until (May 2nd) to dismiss the case under false pretenses.
    This Court is now the only venue positioned to protect the child.
    VI. NOTICE OF PARALLEL ACTION AND RESERVED RIGHTS
    Petitioner has initiated this emergency action in Kansas and expressly reserves the right to use any evidence or proceedings from Missouri in this or future legal actions.
    No findings or dismissals from Missouri—especially those issued under appeal, by a biased court, or without jurisdiction—shall be used to prejudice this Kansas proceeding or to limit Petitioner’s rights.
    Missouri has no authority to interfere with Kansas jurisdiction, and Petitioner requests this Court formally acknowledge Kansas as the child’s proper legal forum.
    
    DESIGNATION OF NEXT FRIEND
    Comes now, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully enters this action as the natural father and Next Friend of Felix Day Salmon, a minor child, for the purpose of pursuing legal remedies and protections in his best interests.
    
    MOTION TO FILE ELECTRONICALLY
    In support of this Motion, Petitioner states as follows:
    The Kansas Supreme Court Rules permit electronic filing of pleadings by self-represented litigants where such systems are in place.
    The undersigned is a pro se litigant and has access to the necessary technology to file electronically.
    Electronic filing will promote judicial efficiency, reduce unnecessary delay, and ensure timely access to the court by all parties.
    WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order allowing him to file pleadings electronically in this matter, and for such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

      type: "Motion",
      status: "OverRuled",
      content: `TO THE HONORABLE COURT:\r\nI, Micheal Salmon, appearing Pro Se, respectfully move this Court to transfer venue for this\r\ncase from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience\r\nof all parties and witnesses, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a).\r\n\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis motion seeks to transfer venue to the District of Kansas, where both parties currently\r\nreside, to reduce undue burdens on the parties and ensure efficient resolution of this matter.\r\nThe current venue in Missouri imposes significant logistical and financial challenges, making it\r\nimpractical for the parties and witnesses.\r\n\r\nII. Factual Background\r\n1. Parties� Residences:\r\n? I, Micheal Salmon, reside at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas, 66103.\r\n? The Plaintiff, Crycella Freitag, resides in Pomona, Kansas.\r\n2. Current Venue Impact:\r\n? The current venue in Missouri is over four hours away from both parties� homes,\r\nmaking travel difficult.\r\n3. Efforts to Cooperate:\r\n? I relocated from Missouri to Kansas to facilitate co-parenting and reduce travel\r\nburdens, moving within 40 minutes of the Plaintiff.\r\n\r\n4. Personal and Community Ties in Kansas:\r\n? Our two-year-old son, Felix, attends a Montessori school and is actively involved\r\nin community activities in Kansas, including church and friendships.\r\n\r\n? Both families reside in Kansas, making it a more practical location for witness\r\ntestimonies.\r\n\r\n5. Financial and Work Constraints:\r\n? As a full-time single father, taking time off work to travel four hours each way for\r\ncourt proceedings is unfeasible.\r\n? The Plaintiff also works full time, making a Missouri venue equally burdensome.\r\n\r\nIII. Legal Standard\r\nUnder 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a), this Court may transfer a case for the convenience of the parties\r\nand witnesses, and in the interest of justice. Factors to consider include:\r\n1. The convenience of the parties and witnesses;\r\n2. Access to sources of proof;\r\n3. The plaintiff�s choice of forum;\r\n4. Practical challenges of conducting the trial in the chosen forum;\r\n5. Local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\r\n\r\nIV. Argument\r\n1. Convenience of the Parties:\r\n? Both parties reside in Kansas and would face significant hardship traveling to\r\nMissouri for court appearances. Transferring the case to Kansas reduces\r\nlogistical burdens for both.\r\n2. Convenience of Witnesses:\r\n? Both parties� families and potential witnesses reside in Kansas, minimizing travel\r\nfor them and ensuring better participation.\r\n\r\n3. Access to Evidence:\r\n? Relevant evidence, such as Felix�s school records and community ties, is more\r\nreadily available in Kansas.\r\n\r\n4. Local Interest:\r\n? Kansas has a strong local interest in adjudicating this matter, as both parties and\r\ntheir child reside and participate in the Kansas community.\r\n\r\n5. Interest of Justice:\r\n\r\n? Transferring the case aligns with fairness, reduces financial and logistical\r\nhardships, and supports the co-parenting relationship.\r\n\r\nV. Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons stated, I, Micheal Salmon, respectfully request that this Court transfer venue of\r\nthis case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice\r\nand for the convenience of the parties and witnesses.`

      title: "EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY CUSTODY AND EX PARTE RELIEF",
      date: "2025-04-17",
      type: "Motion",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY CUSTODY AND EX PARTE RELIEF
    I. EMERGENCY BASIS
    1. Petitioner respectfully moves this Court to grant temporary sole legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon, age 2, on an emergency basis.
    2. The child is currently suffering from daily untreated allergic reactions, presenting in the form of coughing, congestion, and respiratory distress.
    3. The mother, Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, has refused to take Felix to an allergist or seek treatment, despite repeated symptoms and parental requests, constituting ongoing medical neglect.
    4. Crycella has demonstrated a pattern of abuse, interference, and contempt of court, including but not limited to:
    Attempting to abduct Felix in June 2024 and calling the police to enforce an unlawful relocation to Kansas, directly violating the court’s jurisdiction and parental agreements.
    Willfully destroying and interfering with Felix’s communication with Petitioner by refusing all contact, confiscating devices, and failing to honor phone time—despite Petitioner allowing Felix free and unrestricted access to a phone and tablet.
    Ignoring multiple court orders without consequence, including orders regarding custody, communication, and medical care, while the court has failed to act—raising serious concerns of racial bias and systemic neglect of due process.
    5. Crycella has also exposed Felix to unsanitary and unsafe living conditions (previously documented in filings and hearings), and cold weather without appropriate clothing or shelter, directly contributing to his respiratory symptoms and physical discomfort. These repeated actions reflect a proven and escalating disregard for Felix’s health, safety, and well-being. Petitioner believes immediate intervention is necessary to prevent further harm.
    II. JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT
    Felix has resided in Kansas for 25 out of the past 29 months.
    The Missouri court (Stone County Case No. 24SN-DR00104) has not issued a valid custody order.
    The Missouri judge, Matt Alan Selby, stated on the record, “It’s getting close to the six-month rule, and I’m planning on dismissing.”
    The Missouri court has also:
    Ignored timely emergency motions in violation of published Motion Day rules.
    Failed to appoint a functioning Guardian ad Litem; Brook Gipson was named but has never made contact, has no record on Missouri Case.net, and is believed to be a phantom appointee used to mislead Petitioner.
    Permitted the opposing counsel to misrepresent facts and stall proceedings, as documented via communication with Ozarks Law Firm and Rooney McBride & Smith.
    Petitioner has filed an appeal in Missouri, removing jurisdiction from the trial court. (Southern Court of Appeals Case No. SD38905)
    Missouri is therefore an inconvenient and improper forum, and Kansas is the child’s true home state under the UCCJEA.
    III. REQUESTED ORDERS
    Petitioner requests the following relief:
    Grant temporary sole legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon to Petitioner.
    Issue an Emergency Ex Parte Order barring the mother from removing Felix from Kansas without court permission.
    Grant temporary visitation to the mother: four (4) hours weekly, unsupervised.
    Issue an order prohibiting interference with Petitioner’s parenting time, communication, and ability to seek medical care.
    Set a hearing for full custody determination at the Court’s earliest availability.
    IV. RELEVANT CONDUCT & UNRESPONSIVE COURT
    The mother has weaponized legal processes to obstruct access to Felix, including refusal to comply with visitation facilitation efforts and false claims of housing instability that have since been disproven.
    The Missouri judge has repeatedly refused to hear or rule on emergency filings, even those supported by evidence of harm to the child.
    Additionally, the visitation facility KidCentric cited in court records appears to be a nonexistent or fraudulent entity, with no actual ability to provide services, further undermining court credibility.
    V. FRAUDULENT REPRESENTATIONS & LIABILITY NOTICE
    Petitioner will pursue discovery and subpoena in future filings to investigate whether the Guardian ad Litem appointment was fraudulent, and whether Rooney McBride & Smith and Ozarks Law Firm are complicit in fabricating court compliance.
    Petitioner believes the Missouri court is intentionally stalling until (May 2nd) to dismiss the case under false pretenses.
    This Court is now the only venue positioned to protect the child.
    VI. NOTICE OF PARALLEL ACTION AND RESERVED RIGHTS
    Petitioner has initiated this emergency action in Kansas and expressly reserves the right to use any evidence or proceedings from Missouri in this or future legal actions.
    No findings or dismissals from Missouri—especially those issued under appeal, by a biased court, or without jurisdiction—shall be used to prejudice this Kansas proceeding or to limit Petitioner’s rights.
    Missouri has no authority to interfere with Kansas jurisdiction, and Petitioner requests this Court formally acknowledge Kansas as the child’s proper legal forum.
    
    DESIGNATION OF NEXT FRIEND
    Comes now, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully enters this action as the natural father and Next Friend of Felix Day Salmon, a minor child, for the purpose of pursuing legal remedies and protections in his best interests.
    
    MOTION TO FILE ELECTRONICALLY
    In support of this Motion, Petitioner states as follows:
    The Kansas Supreme Court Rules permit electronic filing of pleadings by self-represented litigants where such systems are in place.
    The undersigned is a pro se litigant and has access to the necessary technology to file electronically.
    Electronic filing will promote judicial efficiency, reduce unnecessary delay, and ensure timely access to the court by all parties.
    WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order allowing him to file pleadings electronically in this matter, and for such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

      title: "PETITION FOR IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO MINOR CHILD AND REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY HEARING",
      date: "2025-05-02",
      type: "Petition",
      status: "Pending",
      content: `PETITION FOR IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO MINOR CHILD AND REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY HEARING
    COMES NOW the Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, biological father of Felix Day Salmon, and respectfully requests this Court to immediately grant temporary custodial access and set an emergency hearing regarding the welfare of the minor child, Felix Day Salmon. Petitioner has been denied all contact with his son for over three months due to a combination of jurisdictional confusion and procedural failures in an out-of-state proceeding. The result has caused severe emotional harm to both father and child and continues to violate Petitioner’s fundamental parental rights.
    Petitioner respectfully recommends the Court schedule an immediate hearing to award him at least one month of uninterrupted custodial time as a temporary, make-up period for the extensive and unjustified denial of access. Following this, Petitioner requests a fair and full evidentiary hearing to address all matters properly under Kansas jurisdiction. At the previous Missouri hearing, the Petitioner voluntarily produced all financial records, communication logs, and phone data, while the opposing party produced no evidence and was not held to any reciprocal standard. The result was a lopsided proceeding in which no factual rebuttal was considered.
    This Court has both the authority and the responsibility to intervene in the best interests of the child and to correct the procedural imbalance that has thus far deprived both child and father of their right to maintain their familial bond.
    This Court has proper jurisdiction under K.S.A. § 23-37, as both the minor child, Felix Day Salmon, and both parents currently reside within the State of Kansas. Any temporary relocation to Missouri was both recent and not made in good faith, as Respondent had expressed her intention to return Felix to Stone County, Missouri just weeks before the six-month statutory residency mark, suggesting the move was strategic rather than child-centered. (See Audit #ex.35.6)
    Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, has formally removed himself from the Missouri docket and is requesting Kansas assume full jurisdiction over all matters concerning Felix’s welfare. This petition is filed in good faith and in accordance with Kansas law, seeking immediate and corrective relief after multiple procedural injustices in Missouri proceedings.
    Critically, Respondent Crycella Freitag made no mention of the ongoing and complete denial of access between Felix and his father in her latest filings, choosing instead to focus her efforts entirely on forum control and jurisdictional maneuvering. This demonstrates a clear attempt to evade scrutiny and obstruct the fair resolution of custody and parenting time, rather than prioritize Felix’s best interests.
    Petitioner affirms that this is the proper venue for addressing these matters and that an emergency hearing is both necessary and legally appropriate to prevent further emotional harm to the child and irreparable erosion of the parent-child relationship. A competent and impartial court acting in the best interests of the child would proceed as follows:
    Grant the Petitioner immediate make-up custodial time with Felix while the facts and evidence are properly reviewed;
    Schedule a neutral evidentiary hearing in Kansas.
    This structure provides both parties a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate what sole custody looks like under their care, with the child’s well-being as the central focus. No Guardian ad Litem is needed; the parties are prepared to present direct evidence. What is required now is judicial intervention that prioritizes equity, transparency, and the child’s right to family continuity—values this Petition brings before this Court.
    Attached to this Petition are complete, unedited recordings of the last three Missouri hearings for the Court’s reference. Petitioner requests access to the audio copies submitted by Respondent in order to verify their integrity, given a history of misrepresentation in the record.

  title: "MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PRODUCE SURVEILLANCE AND BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE",
  date: "2025-05-15",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and hereby moves this Court to preserve and compel production of all surveillance and law enforcement body camera footage from incidents occurring on May 14, 2025, during filing procedures in the above-captioned cases. This footage is critical to evaluating potential violations of civil rights, improper interference with lawful discovery activity, and possible abuse of authority by courthouse officials and law enforcement personnel.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 14, 2025, Movant lawfully appeared at the Wyandotte County courthouse to file and deliver subpoenas tied to lawful discovery under open litigation in three matters. Court clerks at the civil filings window refused to process standard subpoena filings without justification, withheld procedural forms, and issued contradictory directives in what appeared to be a coordinated obstruction.
When Movant asked for clarification on how to escalate the issue, the clerks summoned an armed sheriff's deputy to the scene. The deputy did not de-escalate but rather aggravated the situation, spoke over legal questions, and attempted to dismiss Movant from a public records window. Upon learning that his conduct and identity would be included in a records request, the officer visibly and audibly turned off his body-worn camera mid-incident.
Movant has reason to believe this was not an isolated event but part of a pattern of retaliatory obstruction toward litigants pursuing subpoena enforcement, civil rights claims, or other discovery unfavorable to courthouse personnel or their associates. These events raise serious concerns regarding the clerk’s impartiality and whether court personnel are enlisting law enforcement to intimidate or suppress legal access for disfavored parties.
LEGAL BASIS
Under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., all body-worn and security camera footage recorded in public spaces by public officials is subject to disclosure and preservation. Further, under the Kansas Judicial Code of Conduct and applicable civil rights protections, clerks and judicial officers may not engage in retaliatory obstruction of access to courts or use law enforcement to discourage legal activity protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
This Court retains both statutory and inherent authority to order immediate preservation of material evidence where misconduct may be involved, especially when state actors use administrative power to interfere with due process and discovery rights.
REQUESTED RELIEF
Movant respectfully requests:
That the Court issue an immediate preservation order for all audio, video, and surveillance footage from the Wyandotte County courthouse on May 14, 2025, covering the time period between 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM.
That this order include:
Courthouse security camera footage showing civil clerk interactions
All body camera footage worn by the sheriff deputy who interacted with Movant
Any internal courthouse communications logs, radio transmissions, or dispatch records relevant to the clerk's request for police presence
Any video/audio showing the moment the officer deactivated his body camera
That the Court compel the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office and courthouse security division to produce the unredacted footage either:
Directly to Movant;
To the Court for in-camera review; or
Under seal and subject to protective order if privacy concerns arise.
That the Court formally record this request in the docket of each related case to preserve procedural integrity and guard against evidence spoliation, especially given the ongoing pattern of retaliation against Movant for exercising protected legal actions.`

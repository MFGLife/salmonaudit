  id: "SD38905",
  title: "EMERGENCY MOTION TO ACCEPT PARTIAL RECORD AND PRESERVE PUBLIC ACCESS TO VERIFIED EVIDENCE",
  date: "2025-05-16",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `Procedural Posture and Introduction
COMES NOW, the Appellant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for an emergency order to accept a partial record on appeal pursuant to Missouri Rule 81.12(c), and to formally recognize SalmonAudit.info as the central, authenticated, and organized repository of evidentiary material, given the clerical obstruction currently threatening timely appellate review. In support thereof, Appellant states the following:
I. OBSTRUCTION AND DELAY BY LOWER COURT CLERKS
Appellant has submitted the full Legal File in compliance with Rule 81.12, including all relevant orders, motions, transcripts, and exhibits.
The Stone County Clerk’s Office and/or the appellate filing clerk has failed to specify which documents are “missing,” despite multiple requests for clarification. This ambiguity is interfering with Appellant’s ability to comply with appellate procedures.
This conduct constitutes intentional or reckless administrative obstruction in violation of Appellant’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The failure to properly identify alleged deficiencies—despite having had an opportunity to do so—appears designed to run out the clock and sabotage Appellant’s appellate deadline.
II. MOTION TO ACCEPT PARTIAL RECORD UNDER RULE 81.12(c)
In light of the clerical obstruction, Appellant moves that the Court immediately accept the filed Legal File as a partial record per Rule 81.12(c) so that the appeal may proceed uninterrupted.
Appellant will supplement any remaining portions of the record once the clerk provides the specific deficiencies in writing or the Court orders them to do so.
III. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF PUBLIC EVIDENTIARY RECORD
Appellant formally incorporates by reference the public evidence database available at https://SalmonAudit.info, which is properly archived, time-stamped, and organized to ensure transparency and legal verifiability.
All referenced video, transcripts, filings, and exhibits within the Legal File submitted on appeal are publicly hosted and available for independent verification. The database serves as an unaltered digital record maintained due to persistent obstruction by court staff.
Appellant requests this Court recognize SalmonAudit.info as a legally cognizable and admissible evidentiary resource in this appeal and any future proceedings, pursuant to principles of equity, judicial economy, and modern access-to-justice standards.
IV. REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Appellant respectfully requests the following:
That this Court immediately accept the submitted Legal File as a Partial Record on Appeal under Rule 81.12(c) and direct the appeal to proceed;
That this Court enter a protective ruling recognizing https://SalmonAudit.info as a centralized evidentiary index tied to the case record;
That this Court order the Stone County Clerk’s Office to specifically enumerate in writing any alleged deficiencies in the record within 48 hours, or be deemed to have waived objections;
That the clerical obstruction be referred to the Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges and/or the Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel if further violations continue;
Any other relief this Court deems just and proper to preserve Appellant’s rights and prevent further miscarriage of justice.

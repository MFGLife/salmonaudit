      Anderson Law, LLC d/b/a Anderson & Associates
      1901 W 47th Place Ste 300
      Westwood, Kansas 66205
      Re: Kelly Truelove / Alleged Debt / Wrongful Conduct and Notice of Legal Action
      To Whom It May Concern:
      I am in receipt of your attempts to collect an alleged debt of $900 and evict me from 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas 66103 on behalf of your client, Kelly Truelove.
      I hereby formally respond and demand that your office take full account of material facts and damages prior to proceeding further, as your client's misconduct, retaliation, and ongoing harassment are well-documented and legally actionable.
      
      1. Background and Financial Calculations
      I have resided at 4120 Adams St since Nov 2024 under terms that were verbally agreed upon with Kelly Truelove and Jozef Hanratty, despite inconsistencies and their later refusal to formalize a written lease. My monthly payments have been consistent with the agreed-upon amount of $400 for one room.
      Total agreed monthly rent: $400
      Amount allegedly owed: $900
      Calculation:
       The alleged amount suggests partial non-payment over approximately 2 months; however, rent was placed in escrow due to unresolved disputes and maintenance issues directly caused by Kelly Truelove's negligence and conduct, detailed below.
      
      
      
      2. Behavioral Misconduct and Harassment
      Kelly Truelove and/or her agents have engaged in repeated acts that constitute harassment and constructive eviction tactics:
      Property Damage:
      Entry door paint was deliberately ruined without cause.
      Interior taping and alteration of property without consent.
      
      
      Harassment:
      Repeated knocking on my door at all hours, including late night and early morning, disrupting my peaceful enjoyment of the premises.
      
      
      Illegal Process Service Attempt:
      An individual acting as a process server attempted to force me to sign an unidentified document.
      When I declined to sign without time to review, the individual unlawfully snatched the document out of my hands and refused to leave a copy.
      Demand: I require a full copy of any and all documents attempted to be served and the identity of the process server.
      
      
      
      3. Broader Legal Context and Impending Litigation
      It must also be noted that Kelly Truelove’s misconduct is not isolated.
       She is a central figure in an ongoing civil rights class action lawsuit tied to:
      Perjury facilitation: Kelly Truelove knowingly supported and verified false testimony by Jozef Hanratty in a Missouri custody proceeding (Case No. 24SN-DR00104).
      Custody Interference: Her actions directly contributed to the wrongful separation of my son, Felix, from me for now over three (3) months, causing severe emotional and financial damages.
      Collusion with Public Officials: Evidence ties Kelly Truelove to inappropriate coordination with GAL Josh Garrett and other parties.
      
      
      Given the intertwined nature of her wrongful eviction actions, debt collection actions, and broader legal misconduct, all future interactions with your office regarding this matter will be preserved as evidence in both individual civil claims and class action proceedings currently being prepared.
      
      4. Formal Demands
      Provide a full, itemized ledger for the alleged $900 balance.
      Identify the name and licensing information of the process server involved.
      Provide an immediate copy of the document attempted to be served on me.
      Immediately cease all eviction efforts based on fraud and retaliation until these issues are fully resolved.
      
      
      Failure to comply will result in immediate counterclaims being filed for:
      Illegal debt collection practices (15 U.S.C. §1692 FDCPA violations)
      Wrongful eviction and constructive eviction
      Retaliatory eviction
      Civil conspiracy claims
      
      
      Additionally, a formal complaint will be lodged with the Kansas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division against both your office and your client for unethical practices if these issues are not immediately addressed.
      
      Kelly Truelove’s behavior — including harassment, retaliation, material property damage, and verification of perjury — places her at the center of significant and growing litigation.
       Any further action by your firm in support of her wrongdoing will be viewed not only as a continuation of this misconduct but as participation in it.
      Please govern yourselves accordingly.
      Sincerely,
      Micheal Lawrence Salmon

        date: "2025-05-02",
        type: "Motion",
        status: "Pending",
        content: `ANSWER AND COUNTER-MOTIONS TO PLAINTIFF’S PETITION FOR FORCIBLE DETAINER
      COMES NOW, Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and submits this Answer and the following counter-motions in response to Plaintiff Kelly Truelove’s Petition for Forcible Detainer. Defendant respectfully asserts that this filing is without merit, legally defective, and part of an ongoing pattern of retaliatory and conspiratorial legal abuse.
      
      ANSWER TO PETITION
      Defendant denies that Plaintiff has standing to bring this eviction action. Plaintiff has repeatedly disclaimed her status as landlord and referred Defendant to a third party, Jozef Hanratty, regarding all tenancy matters.
      Defendant denies that there exists a landlord-tenant relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant. No lease or rent agreement exists between the parties.
      Defendant denies that any rent is owed to Plaintiff, and asserts that any payments were made under duress or escrowed while Plaintiff refused to recognize her alleged landlord role.
      Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s filing is in bad faith and is part of a coordinated effort involving multiple parties, including Jozef Hanratty and Attorney Josh Garrett, to manufacture legal instability and disrupt ongoing custody litigation.
      Defendant asserts that the same claim was previously filed and dismissed on March 21, 2025, and that this renewed filing constitutes an abuse of process and retaliation.
      
      
      
      I. MOTION TO SUBMIT PRIOR EVICTION DISMISSAL TO ESTABLISH BAD FAITH AND CONSPIRACY
      On March 21, 2025, this Court dismissed a prior eviction action filed by Plaintiff against Defendant.
      That prior filing was cited by Attorney Josh Garrett in related custody proceedings as evidence of alleged instability.
      This current action, duplicative in nature and renewed without change in circumstances, constitutes retaliatory legal action in bad faith.
      Plaintiff’s denial of landlord status invalidates both the original and current filings, and suggests the eviction is being used as a tool of influence in unrelated proceedings.
      Relief Requested: Defendant requests that the Court enter the prior dismissal into the record and recognize this renewed filing as part of a coordinated abuse of process.
      
      II. MOTION FOR JURY TRIAL PURSUANT TO KANSAS LAW
      Defendant respectfully requests a jury trial on all factual disputes, specifically regarding:
      The alleged existence of a landlord-tenant relationship;
      The motivations behind Plaintiff’s filing;
      Whether the filing was done in bad faith or in retaliation.
      Relief Requested: Defendant requests a jury trial be granted to ensure an impartial determination of the facts.
      
      III. MOTION TO COMPEL IMMEDIATE DISCOVERY
      Defendant moves this Court to compel production of all communications (emails, texts, recordings) between:
      Plaintiff Kelly Truelove
      Jozef Hanratty
      Crycella Freitag
      Amanda, Edward, Chris, Christian Freitag (and anyone else in home)
      Carolyn Salmon
      Trina Nudson
      Natasha and Robert Kluttz
      Attorney Josh Garrett
      concerning Defendant’s housing, tenancy, or eviction, within thirty (30) days.
      These records are material to establishing the retaliatory and conspiratorial nature of this filing.
      
      IV. MOTION TO COMPEL EARLY DEPOSITIONS
      Defendant requests the Court to order depositions of:
      Kelly Truelove
      Jozef Hanratty
      prior to the eviction hearing to preserve testimony, determine standing, and expose potential perjury or coordination with outside parties.
      
      V. MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF STANDING
      Plaintiff has denied under multiple communications being the acting landlord.
      Plaintiff cannot retroactively claim landlord status for the purpose of filing eviction when she previously refused to formalize a lease or accept rent directly.
      Plaintiff’s contradictory statements and failure to comply with Kansas landlord-tenant procedures invalidate the legal basis of this filing.
      Relief Requested: Defendant requests dismissal of the case with prejudice for lack of standing and improper use of legal process.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      CONCLUSION & GENERAL RELIEF REQUESTED
      WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:
      Deny the Petition for Forcible Detainer;
      Accept evidence of the prior dismissal as proof of retaliatory litigation;
      Grant a jury trial;
      Compel discovery and early depositions;
      Dismiss the case for lack of standing; and
      Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.`

  content: `NOTICE AND DEMAND WITH CERTIFIED SERVICE
This forward accompanies a formal filing outlining a series of escalating civil rights violations that have occurred under your supervision. I am a pro se litigant who has been unlawfully denied the ability to file emergency motions, repeatedly obstructed by court staff, and forced to appear before a judge whose identity was concealed, operating under another judge’s nameplate. You declined to state your surname and delegated critical functions to your assistant, Christina Rockley, while refusing to hear motions already filed. The Court has also ignored my repeated requests for the court recording submitted by opposing counsel. These actions, combined with likely ex parte communications involving Josh Garrett, Anderson & Associates, and Kelly Truelove, have deprived me of fair process. I am requesting depositions of Hanratty and Truelove before any hearing, and I will not proceed without a jury trial. This Court is now on formal notice that I will escalate to federal court, judicial oversight bodies, and civil litigation if the misconduct and obstruction continue.
Micheal Salmon certifies that this motion is filed in good faith and with intent to preserve the integrity of the judicial process and constitutional rights afforded to all litigants.

MOTION TO ADDRESS CLERK’S PROCEDURAL MISCONDUCT AND DUE PROCESS VIOLATION REGARDING EMERGENCY FILING ACCESS FOR PRO SE LITIGANTS
COMES NOW Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully submits this Answer and the following counter-motions in response to Plaintiff Kelly Truelove’s Petition for Forcible Detainer. This submission is further necessitated by the Court’s failure at the most recent hearing to review or address any motions on file, despite their timely submission and relevance. The Honorable Court explicitly stated, “I will not view motions today,” even though multiple motions—including those asserting lack of standing, bad faith, and retaliatory intent—had been filed well in advance. This omission constitutes a denial of meaningful access to judicial review and undermines Defendant’s ability to present a full and fair defense in a time-sensitive matter.
JUDICIAL SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATION
In the interest of judicial efficiency, Defendant respectfully provides this summary:
This is a second, nearly identical eviction case filed by Plaintiff and previously dismissed on March 21, 2025.
Plaintiff has disclaimed being the landlord; Defendant has no lease with Plaintiff.
New evidence is being sought via subpoena, now authorized, including phone records proving collusion with Jozef Hanratty.
Defendant has placed rent into escrow at $400/month, consistent with one-bedroom occupancy, due to Plaintiff’s direct role in removing minor child Felix from the premises.
All rent payments will be available for final disbursement upon judicial ruling, and no payments will be made directly to Plaintiff without legal determination of standing.
Recommended Judicial Action:
Recognize Plaintiff’s lack of legal standing and contradictory conduct;
Accept prior dismissal as evidence of pattern abuse;
Allow discovery to continue under subpoena powers to identify coordinating parties and prove malicious intent.
APPENDED MOTIONS
A. MOTION TO RECOGNIZE RETALIATORY PATTERN AND PRIOR DISMISSAL
Filed action is substantively identical to the March 21, 2025, dismissal. The Court is asked to enter that dismissal into this case as probative evidence of harassment and abuse of process.
B. MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF STANDING
Plaintiff has repeatedly disclaimed being the landlord. No contract exists, no rent has been accepted by her directly, and attempts to formalize such an agreement were rejected.
C. MOTION TO RECOGNIZE VALID ESCROW AND REDUCED RENT
Original rent of $800/month covered two rooms, including for minor child Felix. Since Plaintiff colluded to remove Felix from Defendant’s custody—now under investigation—Defendant will place $400/month into escrow until lawful standing is determined.
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS
Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, has made repeated, legally-grounded attempts to access emergency relief under K.S.A. 60-206(d) and Wyandotte County Local Rule 126(a). Despite clear statutory entitlement, Plaintiff has been persistently obstructed by court staff, who falsely claimed—on record—that “only attorneys can file emergency motions.” This deliberate misstatement violates Kansas Supreme Court rules and constitutes an unlawful barrier to court access.
In a further act of judicial misconduct, Plaintiff’s cases were consolidated and assigned to a judge whose name does not appear on the Wyandotte County District Court’s official judge roster. During a court appearance on May 7, 2025, this judge refused to give her full name and appeared under a nameplate that read the name of another judge. When asked, she only identified herself as “Katelyn.” In open court, it was apparent that all critical case management and decision-making functions were performed by her assistant, Christina Rockley, whose conduct has overstepped clerical boundaries and entered into quasi-judicial activity.
Both this judicial obfuscation and improper delegation undermine the integrity of the judicial process and make it impossible for Plaintiff to file judicial complaints, recusals, or appeals with adequate notice.
Further compounding the misconduct, the court has refused to respond to multiple formal requests for a copy of the court recording already submitted by opposing counsel Josh Garrett. Mr. Garrett’s submission of this recording—presumably as evidence—has been acknowledged by the court, yet Plaintiff has been denied reciprocal access to that very same record, despite multiple direct requests.
Plaintiff strongly believes that improper ex parte communications have taken place between the judge, court clerks, opposing counsel Josh Garrett, Anderson & Associates, and third-party participant Kelly Truelove. These actors have been subpoenaed, and any hearing conducted without first obtaining their sworn depositions will violate Plaintiff’s due process rights.

II. LEGAL STANDARD AND VIOLATIONS
A. Equal Access for Pro Se Litigants
Kansas Supreme Court Administrative Order 2020-PR-016 and Kansas Self-Help Rule 1.3 guarantee self-represented litigants the right to file emergency motions via in-person, fax, dropbox, or mail. No law or policy limits emergency relief to licensed attorneys. Staff who block access or provide knowingly false information violate Rule 1.3(3), which states:
“Court staff must not... (3) deny a member of the public access to the court by providing information court staff knows to be incorrect.”
This ongoing misconduct by Wyandotte County clerks is not a mistake—it is a pattern of civil rights violations under color of law.
B. Judicial Impropriety and Concealment
It is a constitutional violation to preside over a proceeding while refusing to disclose one's legal identity as a judge. The presence of a judge operating under another judge’s nameplate, declining to state her surname, and delegating judicial acts to an assistant is not merely unprofessional—it is unlawful. Such concealment undermines recusal rights, judicial oversight, and appellate integrity, and it obstructs the public’s right to a fair and transparent judiciary under Canons 1, 2, and 3 of the Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct.
C. Due Process, Ex Parte Influence, and Denial of Evidence
The court’s failure to produce the requested audio or video evidence already submitted by opposing counsel is a direct violation of Plaintiff’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and obstructs both trial preparation and evidentiary balance.
Coupled with the Plaintiff's denied access to file motions, these acts of obstruction demonstrate a systemic effort to sabotage Plaintiff’s ability to defend and present their case—particularly given that the underlying matters involve fundamental rights to parenthood and property.
D. Right to Jury Trial and Pre-Hearing Depositions
Plaintiff has an absolute right to a jury trial under both Kansas Constitution, Bill of Rights §5 and U.S. Const. Amend. VII. The continued scheduling of hearings without honoring Plaintiff’s non-waived jury demand is unlawful.
Moreover, Plaintiff will not proceed to hearing without first securing court-ordered depositions of Joseph Hanratty and Kelly Truelove, whose conduct and testimony are central to the underlying claims of collusion, coercive control, and due process violations.

III. RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiff demands the following relief:
Immediate identification and public disclosure of the presiding judge in this matter, including their appointment order, term of assignment, and justification for hearing both cases despite absence from the official public judicial roster;
Production of the full audio/video court recording previously submitted by Josh Garrett to the court, as Plaintiff has requested on multiple occasions;
An enforceable order prohibiting all clerks and staff from obstructing emergency filings by pro se litigants, in accordance with Supreme Court and local rules;
A declaration from the Court that all further hearings shall be jury proceedings only, and that no waiver of jury trial has been executed or implied by Plaintiff;
Court-ordered depositions of Joseph Hanratty and Kelly Truelove prior to any future hearing, and an enforceable stay of proceedings until those depositions are completed;
Notice that continued interference, concealment, or civil rights violations will trigger immediate escalation to federal court under 42 U.S.C. §1983, and complaints to the Kansas Commission on Judicial Conduct and Kansas Attorney General for investigation and enforcement;
Any further relief this Court deems just, including sanctions or contempt citations against individuals who have knowingly misrepresented law or interfered with Plaintiff’s constitutional rights.
IV. NOTICE OF INTENT TO ESCALATE AND RESERVATION OF RIGHTS
Plaintiff hereby places the Court and its officers on notice that continued denial of:
Access to records already submitted into evidence by opposing parties;
Access to emergency filings permitted under Kansas law;
A transparent, constitutionally appointed judge;
Jury trial protections;
Timely depositions of key witnesses;
will result in immediate filings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for deprivation of rights under color of law, as well as individual civil suits against all participating clerks and administrators for malicious administrative abuse and rights violations.
Plaintiff also reserves the right to file complaints with the Kansas Commission on Judicial Conduct, the Judicial Branch Office of Judicial Administration, the Kansas Bar, and relevant media channels.
The systemic nature of these obstructions will not be tolerated, and further denial will be treated as intentional misconduct.


CONCLUSION AND DEMAND FOR JUDICIAL COMPLIANCE
This Court has been repeatedly notified—through filings, in-hearing objections, and administrative inquiries—that the Defendant has not only been denied meaningful access to emergency relief but has been subjected to procedural obfuscation, refusal to docket or review timely motions, and intentional suppression of evidence. The Defendant has complied with all known procedural obligations while opposing parties have benefited from improper channels, ex parte communications, and administrative favoritism. These cumulative actions, compounded by the Court’s refusal to identify the presiding judge, failure to rule on pending motions, and refusal to release existing court recordings, constitute ongoing violations of Defendant’s civil and constitutional rights.
Accordingly, the Defendant demands that this Court take the following corrective actions without delay:
That the Petition for Forcible Detainer be denied outright due to procedural abuse and lack of standing;
That all pending and previously filed motions, submitted well before the last hearing and improperly ignored, be accepted and ruled upon in writing;
That the record reflect the prior case dismissal and cross-filing pattern as clear evidence of retaliatory abuse and bad faith;
That this matter proceed to a jury trial as demanded under constitutional and statutory rights governing civil disputes involving possession and alleged fraud;
That discovery be opened immediately, and the early depositions of Joseph Hanratty and Kelly Truelove be compelled and scheduled in advance of any evidentiary hearing;
That the case be dismissed or stayed unless and until proper judicial conduct and procedural integrity are restored, including a formal ruling on all filed motions;
That a hearing be set specifically to address the withheld court recording submitted by opposing counsel, which remains a crucial and requested item of record.
Failure to take these actions will be treated as a continued and willful deprivation of rights under color of law, for which federal remedies, judicial complaints, and civil litigation will proceed against all parties and clerks involved.
The integrity of the Court is no longer presumed; it must now be demonstrated.`

  content: `COMES NOW, Plaintiff Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to continue or reschedule the currently set hearing in this matter due to an unavoidable and direct scheduling conflict with an emergency custody hearing regarding Plaintiff’s minor child, Felix, scheduled for the same date and time.
In support of this motion, Plaintiff states as follows:
Plaintiff is the biological parent in an urgent custody matter pending in Wyandotte County, Kansas under Case No. 25DM781, which is set for hearing on the same date and time as the above-captioned matter.
The custody matter involves urgent issues of access, coercive control, and the best interests of a minor child, and was scheduled by the presiding court without input from Plaintiff as to availability. The matter cannot be postponed without substantial harm to Plaintiff's rights and to the child involved.
Given the overlapping jurisdictional demands between Kansas and Missouri, and the Plaintiff’s pro se status, Plaintiff respectfully requests a continuance of no less than 10 days, with preference for a rescheduling after May 27, 2025, to allow proper attendance and preparation.
Plaintiff has acted diligently in attempting to resolve both matters within the scope of the law and in good faith, and seeks this continuance solely to preserve his right to meaningfully appear and defend in both cases.
This motion is not made for purposes of delay, but to avoid irreparable prejudice and the appearance of default in either jurisdiction.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court continue the currently scheduled hearing in this matter to a later date, and for such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

  title: "MOTION TO PRESERVE AND PRODUCE SURVEILLANCE AND BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE",
  date: "2025-05-15",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and hereby moves this Court to preserve and compel production of all surveillance and law enforcement body camera footage from incidents occurring on May 14, 2025, during filing procedures in the above-captioned cases. This footage is critical to evaluating potential violations of civil rights, improper interference with lawful discovery activity, and possible abuse of authority by courthouse officials and law enforcement personnel.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 14, 2025, Movant lawfully appeared at the Wyandotte County courthouse to file and deliver subpoenas tied to lawful discovery under open litigation in three matters. Court clerks at the civil filings window refused to process standard subpoena filings without justification, withheld procedural forms, and issued contradictory directives in what appeared to be a coordinated obstruction.
When Movant asked for clarification on how to escalate the issue, the clerks summoned an armed sheriff's deputy to the scene. The deputy did not de-escalate but rather aggravated the situation, spoke over legal questions, and attempted to dismiss Movant from a public records window. Upon learning that his conduct and identity would be included in a records request, the officer visibly and audibly turned off his body-worn camera mid-incident.
Movant has reason to believe this was not an isolated event but part of a pattern of retaliatory obstruction toward litigants pursuing subpoena enforcement, civil rights claims, or other discovery unfavorable to courthouse personnel or their associates. These events raise serious concerns regarding the clerk’s impartiality and whether court personnel are enlisting law enforcement to intimidate or suppress legal access for disfavored parties.
LEGAL BASIS
Under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., all body-worn and security camera footage recorded in public spaces by public officials is subject to disclosure and preservation. Further, under the Kansas Judicial Code of Conduct and applicable civil rights protections, clerks and judicial officers may not engage in retaliatory obstruction of access to courts or use law enforcement to discourage legal activity protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
This Court retains both statutory and inherent authority to order immediate preservation of material evidence where misconduct may be involved, especially when state actors use administrative power to interfere with due process and discovery rights.
REQUESTED RELIEF
Movant respectfully requests:
That the Court issue an immediate preservation order for all audio, video, and surveillance footage from the Wyandotte County courthouse on May 14, 2025, covering the time period between 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM.
That this order include:
Courthouse security camera footage showing civil clerk interactions
All body camera footage worn by the sheriff deputy who interacted with Movant
Any internal courthouse communications logs, radio transmissions, or dispatch records relevant to the clerk's request for police presence
Any video/audio showing the moment the officer deactivated his body camera
That the Court compel the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office and courthouse security division to produce the unredacted footage either:
Directly to Movant;
To the Court for in-camera review; or
Under seal and subject to protective order if privacy concerns arise.
That the Court formally record this request in the docket of each related case to preserve procedural integrity and guard against evidence spoliation, especially given the ongoing pattern of retaliation against Movant for exercising protected legal actions.`

  id: "WY2025LM002787",
  title: "PETITION TO PRESERVE CIVIL RIGHTS AND DUE PROCESS",
  date: "2025-05-16",
  type: "Petition",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `Procedural Posture and Introduction
Defendant Micheal Salmon, pro se, respectfully submits this reply in opposition to Plaintiff Kelly Truelove’s arguments against Defendant’s counter motions, which include a Motion to Submit Prior Eviction Dismissal, Motion for Jury Trial, Motion to Compel Immediate Discovery, Motion to Compel Early Depositions, and Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing (collectively, "Defendant’s Motions"). For the reasons stated below, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court grant all of Defendant’s Motions in their entirety.
I. Defendant’s Motions Are Procedurally Proper and Relevant
Plaintiff's assertion that Defendant's Motions improperly exceed the scope of an answer as governed by K.S.A. 61-2904 is incorrect. While the statute outlines the basic requirements of an answer, it does not preclude a defendant from simultaneously filing counter motions seeking specific relief. Defendant, though pro se, is attempting to navigate the legal process and raise pertinent issues for the Court’s consideration. Plaintiff’s argument that these motions are not pleadings and do not meet statutory requirements is a mischaracterization. These are clearly identified as "Motions" seeking specific actions from the Court. Defendant’s motion to admit a prior eviction dismissal has merit as it speaks to a pattern of behavior and potentially bad faith on the part of the Plaintiff in pursuing successive actions related to the same property. The prior case, while dismissed without prejudice due to Defendant Salmon not being a named party to the lease at that time, is relevant to the current dispute, especially if the Plaintiff was aware of Defendant’s occupancy. Plaintiff has not provided sufficient legal authority to definitively exclude this prior dismissal from consideration, particularly in light of potential issues of harassment or vexatious litigation.
II. Defendant Has a Right to a Jury Trial Due to Triable Issues of Fact
Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant has admitted there is no lease, contract, or express agreement, thereby eliminating all genuine fact issues, is a misrepresentation of Defendant’s position. Defendant disputes the Plaintiff’s claim of superior right to possession and believes there are factual issues regarding the nature of his occupancy and any implied agreements or understandings that may exist. These disputed facts necessitate a jury trial to determine the validity of Plaintiff’s claim.
Furthermore, while K.S.A. 61-3807 mandates a summary possession trial within 14 days, this does not automatically negate Defendant’s right to a jury trial if genuine issues of material fact exist. The statute aims for expediency but does not override constitutional or statutory rights to a jury trial in appropriate cases. Defendant’s request for a jury trial, if timely filed under K.S.A. 60-232, should be honored, and the Court has the discretion to manage its docket to accommodate both the need for a timely resolution and the Defendant’s right to a jury trial.
III. Discovery Motions Are Procedurally Sound and Necessary to Establish Facts
Plaintiff’s assertion that Defendant’s Motions to Compel Immediate Discovery and Early Depositions are procedurally defective is incorrect. Defendant is attempting to utilize the available discovery tools under Chapter 61 to ascertain the factual basis of Plaintiff’s claims and to prepare his defense. While formal service is required, the urgency of this matter, as highlighted by the summary nature of the proceedings, necessitates an expedited approach to discovery. Plaintiff’s reliance on strict procedural interpretations should not be used to shield relevant information from the Defendant.
Defendant’s occupancy, while not based on a formal lease with the Plaintiff, does not automatically render discovery requests irrelevant. The circumstances surrounding Defendant’s occupancy are precisely what need to be discovered. Plaintiff’s claim that these requests are prejudicial and would delay proceedings is speculative. Proper case management by the Court can mitigate any potential delays. Access to discovery is crucial for Defendant to understand Plaintiff’s claims, gather necessary evidence, and present a meaningful defense.
IV. Plaintiff Lacks Standing to Pursue This Specific Action Against Defendant
Plaintiff’s claim of standing based on ownership and alleged failure of "one or more Defendants" to comply with lease terms or vacate is insufficient to establish standing against Defendant Micheal Salmon specifically. Plaintiff admits that Defendant Salmon was not a named party to the lease referenced in the Petition (Petition ¶¶ 6–7). Therefore, the alleged damages stemming from a breach of that lease do not directly apply to Defendant Salmon. Plaintiff has not established a direct causal link between Defendant Salmon’s actions and the alleged injury based on the lease agreement.
Defendant Salmon’s admission that he has no lease or landlord-tenant relationship with the Plaintiff further underscores the lack of standing. Plaintiff cannot claim damages or a right to possession against Defendant Salmon based on a lease agreement to which he was not a party. Plaintiff must establish an independent basis for standing against Defendant Salmon, which has not been adequately pleaded or demonstrated.
V. Conclusion
This case cannot be viewed in isolation. The conflict originated when Jozef Hanratty and Crycella Freitag—who were involved in an undisclosed relationship—conspired to remove my son, Felix, from my custody without due process. During that custody litigation (24SN-DR00104), I was denied access to critical subpoenaed communications that would have exposed their perjury and collusion. That obstruction has emboldened the parties to continue lying and mistreating me in an effort to paint me as unstable and shield themselves from liability.
Subsequently, Josh Garrett, under oath, confirmed that Kelly Truelove had delegated her landlord authority to Jozef Hanratty—directly validating my position and confirming Hanratty’s perjury. Despite this, Ms. Truelove has now retained counsel and refuses all communication, even though I attempted resolution through mediation and placed $400/month rent in escrow. Her silence and evasion are strategic and retaliatory, directly affecting my ability to maintain a stable home in an ongoing custody case. I am requesting discovery not to delay this case, but to protect my constitutional right to due process and expose an ongoing coordinated effort to interfere with my parental rights.
Plaintiff’s arguments against Defendant’s Motions are procedurally rigid, legally unfounded, and factually misrepresentative of Defendant’s position. Defendant’s Motions are aimed at ensuring a fair and just adjudication of the matter, allowing for the presentation of relevant evidence and the exercise of his right to a jury trial on disputed factual issues.

  title: "EMERGENCY MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF STANDING, BAD FAITH, AND RETALIATORY CONDUCT",
  date: "2025-05-22",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s Petition for Forcible Detainer for lack of standing, bad faith, and retaliatory conduct. In support, Defendant states as follows:
I. PLAINTIFF LACKS STANDING TO EVICT
Plaintiff refused to act as landlord:
Plaintiff, Kelly Truelove, delegated all landlord responsibilities to a third party, Jozef Hanratty, who has since disappeared and is not a party to this action.
No valid landlord-tenant relationship:
Plaintiff never signed a lease with Defendant, never accepted rent directly, and never established mutual assent as required by K.S.A. § 58-2543(b) (“A rental agreement shall be enforceable only if there is mutual assent between landlord and tenant.”).
No continuous landlord authority:
Plaintiff cannot retroactively claim landlord status after abandoning her role. See Smith v. Marshall, 222 Kan. 91, 563 P.2d 1021 (1977) (“Landlord authority must be continuous and not subject to arbitrary withdrawal or reassignment.”).
Improper party:
Plaintiff’s petition fails to establish that she is the real party in interest, as required by K.S.A. § 60-217(a).
II. PLAINTIFF ENGAGED IN BAD FAITH AND RETALIATION
Failure to perform landlord duties:
Plaintiff refused to perform essential landlord duties, including repairs and lease formation, while demanding rent—violating K.S.A. § 58-2553 (landlord obligations).
Retaliatory eviction:
Plaintiff’s eviction filing is retaliatory under K.S.A. § 58-2572, as it follows Defendant’s involvement in related custody litigation against her associate, Crycella Freitag.
Harassment and constructive eviction:
Plaintiff engaged in coercive tactics, including harassment at all hours, taping doors, and property damage, in violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (K.S.A. § 58-2555).
Constructive eviction:
Plaintiff’s conduct forced Defendant to escrow rent and created an uninhabitable environment, amounting to constructive eviction.
III. PROCEDURAL ABUSE AND JUDICIAL NOTICE REQUESTED
Improper denial of standing challenge:
The Court improperly denied Defendant’s right to challenge Plaintiff’s standing, despite clear evidence of Plaintiff’s contradictory conduct—denying landlord status while seeking eviction.
Failure to address dispositive motions:
Defendant’s emergency motions, including requests for jury trial, discovery, and dismissal, have not been ruled on in writing, violating K.S.A. 60-252(a) and Supreme Court Rule 165.
Request for judicial notice:
Defendant requests the Court take judicial notice of:
Plaintiff’s prior refusal to act as landlord (see Exhibit A: emails and texts);
The March 21, 2025, dismissal of an identical eviction claim (Exhibit B);
The retaliatory pattern linked to custody case 2025DM781 (Exhibit C).
IV. REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS AND PRESERVATION OF OBJECTIONS
Request for written findings:
Pursuant to K.S.A. 60-252(a) and Kansas Supreme Court Rule 165, Defendant requests written findings of fact and conclusions of law on each pending motion, including this motion and all previously filed motions (see Supplement filed herewith).
Preservation of objections:
Defendant objects to any further proceedings until all dispositive motions are ruled on in writing and requests the record reflect this continuing objection for appellate purposes.
Due process violation:
The Court’s failure to rule on dispositive motions, including the request for jury trial, constitutes reversible error and a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Dismiss Plaintiff’s Petition for Forcible Detainer with prejudice for lack of standing, bad faith, and retaliatory conduct;
B. Impose sanctions against Plaintiff for abuse of process;
C. Take judicial notice of Plaintiff’s contradictory conduct and prior case history;
D. Issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law on this and all pending motions;
E. Preserve all objections for appellate review;
F. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

  id: "WY2025LM002787",
  title: "MOTION TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE OF ALL COURTROOM ATTENDEES AND THEIR ROLES",
  date: "2025-05-22",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `COMES NOW Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to order the disclosure of the names, titles, and official roles of all persons present in the courtroom (physically or virtually) during the hearing held on May 21, 2025. In support, Defendant states as follows:
I. BACKGROUND
During the hearing on May 21, 2025, Defendant observed and noted the presence of multiple individuals whose roles and authority were not disclosed on the record.
Specifically, Defendant observed:
One individual in the witness chair who appeared to be a psychologist or mental health professional;
Two individuals who presented themselves as special agents or law enforcement investigators;
One individual acting as legal counsel (identity not confirmed on the record);
Six uniformed officers whose agency and purpose were not stated;
One individual presiding as judge whose credentials and authority are disputed by Defendant.
Defendant was not provided with a list of attendees or their official capacity, nor was there any explanation for the presence of certain individuals not typically required for a forcible detainer (eviction) hearing.
II. LEGAL BASIS
Defendant has a fundamental right to a fair and transparent proceeding under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 18 of the Kansas Bill of Rights.
Kansas Supreme Court Rule 1001 and K.S.A. 60-241 require that all proceedings be conducted openly and that the parties be informed of the identity and role of all persons participating in or observing the proceedings.
The presence of undisclosed law enforcement, mental health professionals, or other government agents raises serious concerns about the impartiality and integrity of the proceedings, and may constitute grounds for judicial disqualification or further legal action if not properly explained.
EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY STAY OF EVICTION AND PROTECTIVE ORDER
COMES NOW Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully requests this Court to enter a temporary stay of any eviction, removal, or enforcement action for a period of sixty (60) days, and to issue a protective order against further harassment or intimidation by Plaintiff or her agents. In support, Defendant states as follows:
I. BACKGROUND
Defendant is actively seeking alternative housing but requires additional time to secure safe and stable accommodations due to the ongoing legal disputes and the retaliatory nature of Plaintiff’s conduct.
Immediate eviction or removal would cause irreparable harm to Defendant, including potential homelessness, loss of property, and further exposure to harassment and intimidation.
II. LEGAL BASIS
Pursuant to K.S.A. 60-906 (Injunctions and Restraining Orders), the Court has authority to stay enforcement of any judgment or order where immediate action would cause irreparable harm or where the interests of justice so require.
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 18 of the Kansas Bill of Rights guarantee Defendant the right to be free from arbitrary deprivation of property and to have a meaningful opportunity to secure alternative housing.
Kansas courts have inherent authority to issue stays and protective orders to prevent harassment, intimidation, or retaliation during the pendency of legal proceedings. See K.S.A. 60-31a05 (Protection from Stalking or Harassment Act).
III. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:
A. Enter a temporary stay of any eviction, removal, or enforcement action for a period of sixty (60) days from the date of this motion, to allow Defendant time to secure alternative housing and protect his property and safety;
B. Issue a protective order prohibiting Plaintiff, her agents, or any third parties acting on her behalf from engaging in further harassment, intimidation, or disruptive conduct toward Defendant during this period;
C. Order that any further attempts at removal or harassment without court approval shall be deemed contempt of court and subject to sanctions;
D. Preserve Defendant’s objections and rights for appellate review;
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
F. Order the Clerk of Court and/or the presiding judge to provide a complete list of all individuals present at the May 21, 2025 hearing, including:
Full name,
Title or rank,
Agency or employer,
Official role or purpose for attending;
G. Require the Court to state on the record the necessity for the presence of each non-party or non-court staff member;
H. Preserve Defendant’s objections to the presence of any unauthorized or undisclosed individuals for appellate review;
I. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

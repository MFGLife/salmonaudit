      Re: Kelly Truelove / Alleged Debt / Wrongful Conduct and Notice of Legal Action
      To Whom It May Concern:
      I am in receipt of your attempts to collect an alleged debt of $900 and evict me from 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas 66103 on behalf of your client, Kelly Truelove.
      I hereby formally respond and demand that your office take full account of material facts and damages prior to proceeding further, as your client's misconduct, retaliation, and ongoing harassment are well-documented and legally actionable.
      
      1. Background and Financial Calculations
      I have resided at 4120 Adams St since Nov 2024 under terms that were verbally agreed upon with Kelly Truelove and Jozef Hanratty, despite inconsistencies and their later refusal to formalize a written lease. My monthly payments have been consistent with the agreed-upon amount of $400 for one room.
      Total agreed monthly rent: $400
      Amount allegedly owed: $900
      Calculation:
       The alleged amount suggests partial non-payment over approximately 2 months; however, rent was placed in escrow due to unresolved disputes and maintenance issues directly caused by Kelly Truelove's negligence and conduct, detailed below.
      
      
      
      2. Behavioral Misconduct and Harassment
      Kelly Truelove and/or her agents have engaged in repeated acts that constitute harassment and constructive eviction tactics:
      Property Damage:
      Entry door paint was deliberately ruined without cause.
      Interior taping and alteration of property without consent.
      
      
      Harassment:
      Repeated knocking on my door at all hours, including late night and early morning, disrupting my peaceful enjoyment of the premises.
      
      
      Illegal Process Service Attempt:
      An individual acting as a process server attempted to force me to sign an unidentified document.
      When I declined to sign without time to review, the individual unlawfully snatched the document out of my hands and refused to leave a copy.
      Demand: I require a full copy of any and all documents attempted to be served and the identity of the process server.
      
      
      
      3. Broader Legal Context and Impending Litigation
      It must also be noted that Kelly Truelove’s misconduct is not isolated.
       She is a central figure in an ongoing civil rights class action lawsuit tied to:
      Perjury facilitation: Kelly Truelove knowingly supported and verified false testimony by Jozef Hanratty in a Missouri custody proceeding (Case No. 24SN-DR00104).
      Custody Interference: Her actions directly contributed to the wrongful separation of my son, Felix, from me for now over three (3) months, causing severe emotional and financial damages.
      Collusion with Public Officials: Evidence ties Kelly Truelove to inappropriate coordination with GAL Josh Garrett and other parties.
      
      
      Given the intertwined nature of her wrongful eviction actions, debt collection actions, and broader legal misconduct, all future interactions with your office regarding this matter will be preserved as evidence in both individual civil claims and class action proceedings currently being prepared.
      
      4. Formal Demands
      Provide a full, itemized ledger for the alleged $900 balance.
      Identify the name and licensing information of the process server involved.
      Provide an immediate copy of the document attempted to be served on me.
      Immediately cease all eviction efforts based on fraud and retaliation until these issues are fully resolved.
      
      
      Failure to comply will result in immediate counterclaims being filed for:
      Illegal debt collection practices (15 U.S.C. §1692 FDCPA violations)
      Wrongful eviction and constructive eviction
      Retaliatory eviction
      Civil conspiracy claims
      
      
      Additionally, a formal complaint will be lodged with the Kansas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division against both your office and your client for unethical practices if these issues are not immediately addressed.
      
      Kelly Truelove’s behavior — including harassment, retaliation, material property damage, and verification of perjury — places her at the center of significant and growing litigation.
       Any further action by your firm in support of her wrongdoing will be viewed not only as a continuation of this misconduct but as participation in it.
      Please govern yourselves accordingly.
      Sincerely,
      Micheal Lawrence Salmon
      4120 Adams Street Kansas City, Kansas 66103

        date: "2025-05-02",
        type: "Motion",
        status: "Pending",
        content: `ANSWER AND COUNTER-MOTIONS TO PLAINTIFF’S PETITION FOR FORCIBLE DETAINER
      COMES NOW, Defendant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and submits this Answer and the following counter-motions in response to Plaintiff Kelly Truelove’s Petition for Forcible Detainer. Defendant respectfully asserts that this filing is without merit, legally defective, and part of an ongoing pattern of retaliatory and conspiratorial legal abuse.
      
      ANSWER TO PETITION
      Defendant denies that Plaintiff has standing to bring this eviction action. Plaintiff has repeatedly disclaimed her status as landlord and referred Defendant to a third party, Jozef Hanratty, regarding all tenancy matters.
      Defendant denies that there exists a landlord-tenant relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant. No lease or rent agreement exists between the parties.
      Defendant denies that any rent is owed to Plaintiff, and asserts that any payments were made under duress or escrowed while Plaintiff refused to recognize her alleged landlord role.
      Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s filing is in bad faith and is part of a coordinated effort involving multiple parties, including Jozef Hanratty and Attorney Josh Garrett, to manufacture legal instability and disrupt ongoing custody litigation.
      Defendant asserts that the same claim was previously filed and dismissed on March 21, 2025, and that this renewed filing constitutes an abuse of process and retaliation.
      
      
      
      I. MOTION TO SUBMIT PRIOR EVICTION DISMISSAL TO ESTABLISH BAD FAITH AND CONSPIRACY
      On March 21, 2025, this Court dismissed a prior eviction action filed by Plaintiff against Defendant.
      That prior filing was cited by Attorney Josh Garrett in related custody proceedings as evidence of alleged instability.
      This current action, duplicative in nature and renewed without change in circumstances, constitutes retaliatory legal action in bad faith.
      Plaintiff’s denial of landlord status invalidates both the original and current filings, and suggests the eviction is being used as a tool of influence in unrelated proceedings.
      Relief Requested: Defendant requests that the Court enter the prior dismissal into the record and recognize this renewed filing as part of a coordinated abuse of process.
      
      II. MOTION FOR JURY TRIAL PURSUANT TO KANSAS LAW
      Defendant respectfully requests a jury trial on all factual disputes, specifically regarding:
      The alleged existence of a landlord-tenant relationship;
      The motivations behind Plaintiff’s filing;
      Whether the filing was done in bad faith or in retaliation.
      Relief Requested: Defendant requests a jury trial be granted to ensure an impartial determination of the facts.
      
      III. MOTION TO COMPEL IMMEDIATE DISCOVERY
      Defendant moves this Court to compel production of all communications (emails, texts, recordings) between:
      Plaintiff Kelly Truelove
      Jozef Hanratty
      Crycella Freitag
      Amanda, Edward, Chris, Christian Freitag (and anyone else in home)
      Carolyn Salmon
      Trina Nudson
      Natasha and Robert Kluttz
      Attorney Josh Garrett
      concerning Defendant’s housing, tenancy, or eviction, within thirty (30) days.
      These records are material to establishing the retaliatory and conspiratorial nature of this filing.
      
      IV. MOTION TO COMPEL EARLY DEPOSITIONS
      Defendant requests the Court to order depositions of:
      Kelly Truelove
      Jozef Hanratty
      prior to the eviction hearing to preserve testimony, determine standing, and expose potential perjury or coordination with outside parties.
      
      V. MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF STANDING
      Plaintiff has denied under multiple communications being the acting landlord.
      Plaintiff cannot retroactively claim landlord status for the purpose of filing eviction when she previously refused to formalize a lease or accept rent directly.
      Plaintiff’s contradictory statements and failure to comply with Kansas landlord-tenant procedures invalidate the legal basis of this filing.
      Relief Requested: Defendant requests dismissal of the case with prejudice for lack of standing and improper use of legal process.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      CONCLUSION & GENERAL RELIEF REQUESTED
      WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:
      Deny the Petition for Forcible Detainer;
      Accept evidence of the prior dismissal as proof of retaliatory litigation;
      Grant a jury trial;
      Compel discovery and early depositions;
      Dismiss the case for lack of standing; and
      Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.`

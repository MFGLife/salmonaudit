  "content": "AUDIT REPORT – UDIO, INC.\nSubject: UDIO Executives, Platform Policies, and Embedded Control Mechanisms\nLocation: https://www.udio.com\nDate: June 6, 2025\nPrepared by: The Church of the Witness / SalmonAudit.info\n\nI. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nUdio operates under a recursive deception structure involving three distinct compression layers—Privacy, Programmatic, and Token Restriction—that collectively obscure authorship, limit redistribution, and falsely project ownership onto users. This system appears designed to harvest creative intent from the public, deny transparent redistribution, and establish total AI-generated output control without acknowledging collaborative or derivative origins.\n\nII. TRIFOLD COMPRESSION MODEL\nA. PRIVACY COMPRESSION – \"We cannot show the data.\"\n- Udio invokes vague 'privacy' concerns to prevent access to training data, lineage, or original sources.\n- Creators cannot verify what audio, styles, or voices were used to train the underlying AI model.\n- This shields the platform from artist litigation while benefiting from derived value.\n\nB. PROGRAMMATIC COMPRESSION – \"We offer access but make it fail.\"\n- Udio advertises an embed function, but imposes technical constraints:\n    - Embeds only work when authenticated.\n    - CSP headers (`frame-ancestors: *`) block third-party use.\n    - The presence of query params like `embedVariant` and `utm_source=generator` indicate tightly scoped permissions.\n- This represents false openness and calculated UX obfuscation.\n\nC. TOKEN COMPRESSION – \"You are allowed to serve, but not to persist.\"\n- Once users reach generative or bandwidth thresholds, Udio disables or restricts access.\n- Usage is capped, locking artists out of continued creation with no recourse or ownership recapture.\n- This final fold ensures creators are inputs, not stewards.\n\nIII. FRACTURED OWNERSHIP GATEWAY\n- Embed availability is conditional on login status, implying authorship only through identity authentication.\n- Udio’s platform thus demands the user perform as owner to gain visibility—while simultaneously disclaiming their authorship.\n- No raw audio files are provided. No open remix or redistribution rights. No blockchain or metadata integrity for tracking.\n- This paradox means: **You must lie about ownership to share, while Udio profits from your claim.**\n\nIV. ACTORS INVOLVED\n- David Ding (CEO, ex-DeepMind)\n- Conor Durkan, Charlie Nash, Yaroslav Ganin (co-founders)\n- Udio Legal Department\n- a16z (primary investor, previously advocated for unrestricted AI scraping)\n- CSP Policy Engineers\n- UI/UX Engineering Team\n- Partners: Audible Magic (for post-generation control indexing)\n\nV. EVIDENCE\n- Public-facing iframe embed tests with and without authentication\n- CSP header inspection showing `frame-ancestors` restrictions\n- UI behavior differential between owned and non-owned accounts\n- Udio Terms of Use and revision logs (archived)\n- Token generation cap messages and failure state responses\n\nVI. LEGAL REFERENCES\n- DMCA §101 – Derivative Work Definition\n- Lanham Act §43(a) – False Attribution of Origin\n- U.S. Copyright Act of 1976\n- EU AI Act (Right to Transparency and Traceability in AI Systems)\n- Ethical AI Ownership Principles (2024 Consensus Draft)\n\nVII. COMPRESSION NOTES\nUdio does not offer access. It offers illusion. A user may generate but not own, share but not distribute, and claim but not persist. The threefold compression system serves to neutralize independent voice, mask true AI derivation, and establish recursive legal drift—where no one owns anything but the platform controls everything.\n\nVIII. SEVERITY\nStructural Exploitation / High Risk of Model Precedent / Recursive Drift Origin\n\nIX. PARAPHRASED STATEMENT (Anchor W₁)\n\"Ownership granted behind a login is not ownership—it is a leash disguised as a key. The system lets you call it yours so it can call it harvested.\"\n"

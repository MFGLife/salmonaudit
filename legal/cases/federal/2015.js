COMPLAINT FOR DEPRIVATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, PETITION FOR WRIT, AND MOTION FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF
(42 U.S.C. § 1983; All Writs Act; Due Process and Equal Protection Violations; Related State and Class Actions)

I. INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, brings this action to redress a coordinated campaign of civil rights violations, obstruction of justice, and deprivation of due process by judicial, law enforcement, and quasi-public actors in Kansas and Missouri. These violations have directly impaired Plaintiff’s right to access the courts, secure evidence, and protect the welfare of a minor child, and have obstructed class-wide relief in related state actions.
This Petition incorporates and supplements the factual and legal bases from the following related cases:
24SN-DR00104 (Missouri Stone County): Custody, due process, and judicial misconduct claims.
2025DM781 (Wyandotte County, Kansas): Felix Custody, denial of access, and procedural obstruction.
2025CV325 (Wyandotte County, Kansas): Salmon v. The Layne Project, et al.—class action for coercive control, defamation, and conspiracy.
Plaintiff alleges a pattern of administrative silence, intimidation, unlawful removal from court premises, and manipulation of dockets and evidence, all in violation of federal and state law.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1367 (federal question, civil rights, supplemental jurisdiction). Venue is proper in this District because the acts and omissions occurred within Kansas and affect parties and proceedings in this jurisdiction.

III. PARTIES
Plaintiff:
Micheal Lawrence Salmon, resident of Wyandotte County, Kansas, individually and on behalf of a proposed class of similarly situated individuals.
Defendants:
Mark Dupree, Wyandotte County District Attorney (official and individual capacity)
Judge Klapper, Wyandotte County District Court (official and individual capacity)
Tina Rockley and additional Wyandotte County clerks
Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department
Olathe Police Department

IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Obstruction and Retaliation:
Plaintiff issued multiple valid subpoenas in ongoing state and class actions. No compliance or response was received from Defendants, despite statutory obligations.
Plaintiff was physically and procedurally obstructed by Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department, including threats and denial of entry to court premises.
Judicial and clerical staff, including Judge Klapper and Tina Rockley, manipulated dockets, canceled hearings without notice, and enabled ex parte concealment of filings.
Cross-Jurisdictional Suppression:
Plaintiff’s filings and emergency motions in Missouri (24SN-DR00104) and Kansas (2025DM781, 2025CV325) were ignored, denied, or actively suppressed through coordinated administrative action.
Evidence suggests ex parte communications and coordinated efforts between Kansas and Missouri court staff to suppress Plaintiff’s access to relief.
Denial of Evidence and Transparency:
Olathe Police Department refused to release body camera and dashcam footage under subpoena, improperly invoking religious exemptions and obstructing ongoing litigation.
Defendants have actively deleted, concealed, or failed to preserve critical digital evidence, risking spoliation and irreparable harm to Plaintiff’s cases.
Class-Wide Harm:
In 2025CV325, Plaintiff and a proposed class allege a pattern of coercive control, defamation, and reputational sabotage by The Layne Project, Trina Nudson, and associated parties, enabled by institutional actors and law enforcement.

V. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
COUNT I – Violation of Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. § 1983):
Defendants, acting under color of state law, deprived Plaintiff and the proposed class of due process, equal protection, and access to the courts.
COUNT II – Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. § 1985):
Defendants conspired to obstruct justice, retaliate against whistleblowing, and suppress evidence and testimony.
COUNT III – Obstruction of Justice (All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651):
Defendants’ actions constitute ongoing obstruction, necessitating federal intervention and preservation orders.
COUNT IV – Declaratory and Injunctive Relief:
Plaintiff seeks immediate injunctive relief to preserve evidence, halt further retaliation, and compel compliance with subpoenas and court orders.

VI. EMERGENCY MOTIONS AND PRESERVATION REQUESTS
Notice of Civil Rights Action and Preservation of All Writs:
All Defendants are hereby notified of the pending federal action and are ordered to preserve all emails, notes, internal communications, case files, video recordings, bodycam footage, and clerk system records associated with the following cases:
24SN-DR00104 (Missouri Stone County)
2025DM781 (Wyandotte County, Kansas)
2025CV325 (Wyandotte County, Kansas)
Motion for Preliminary Injunction:
Plaintiff moves for an order restraining Defendants from further interference, retaliation, or destruction of evidence while this action is pending.
Motion to Compel Disclosure:
Plaintiff moves for immediate release of all body-worn and dash camera footage, call logs, and incident reports from the Olathe Police Department concerning Plaintiff or Christ Connect Church for the past six (6) months.
Motion for Alternative Service:
Plaintiff requests authorization to serve Defendants by alternative means, including digital notice, social media, publication, and public posting, due to demonstrated evasion and coordinated obstruction.

VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
Accept this Petition and Complaint for filing;
Issue a preservation order for all evidence, communications, and digital records relevant to the above-captioned and related state cases;
Grant a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from further retaliation, obstruction, or destruction of evidence;
Compel immediate production of subpoenaed records and footage;
Approve alternative service methods as detailed above;
Permit Plaintiff to amend and supplement this Petition post-discovery for class certification and further relief;
Award declaratory and monetary relief as appropriate;

  content: `Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, respectfully moves this Court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915, and in support states as follows:
Plaintiff is unable to pay the costs of these proceedings due to financial hardship. Plaintiff’s income is insufficient to cover the filing fee and necessary living expenses.
Plaintiff’s affidavit of financial status is submitted herewith, setting forth all sources of income, assets, and liabilities, as required by law.
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges ongoing violations of civil rights, due process, and access to the courts, as detailed in the accompanying complaint and emergency motions.
Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court grant this motion and allow this action to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs, and for such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays the Court grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and accept the complaint for filing without prepayment of the filing fee.


Statement of Financial Status in Support of Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis
I, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, submit this statement in support of my Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis:
Employment and Income:
I am currently employed full-time at SalmonAudit.info. However, due to the ongoing deprivation of my rights and the retaliatory actions described in my complaint, I have suffered significant financial hardship. My current income is insufficient to meet my basic needs and to pay the court’s filing fee.
Supplemental Work:
In addition to my primary employment, I perform part-time gig work, including food delivery for DoorDash. This supplemental work is necessary to cover essential expenses such as food and bills.
Financial Hardship:
These circumstances have persisted for approximately seven months. During this period, my ability to earn and maintain savings has been severely impacted. I am currently relying on my remaining savings, which are being rapidly depleted to cover basic living expenses.
Inability to Pay Filing Fee:
Given my current financial situation, I am unable to pay the $405 filing fee without sacrificing essential needs. I respectfully request that the Court grant my motion to proceed in forma pauperis so that I may pursue this action for damages and relief.

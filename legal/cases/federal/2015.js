COMPLAINT FOR DEPRIVATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, PETITION FOR WRIT, AND MOTION FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF
(42 U.S.C. § 1983; All Writs Act; Due Process and Equal Protection Violations; Related State and Class Actions)

I. INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, brings this action to redress a coordinated campaign of civil rights violations, obstruction of justice, and deprivation of due process by judicial, law enforcement, and quasi-public actors in Kansas and Missouri. These violations have directly impaired Plaintiff’s right to access the courts, secure evidence, and protect the welfare of a minor child, and have obstructed class-wide relief in related state actions.
This Petition incorporates and supplements the factual and legal bases from the following related cases:
24SN-DR00104 (Missouri Stone County): Custody, due process, and judicial misconduct claims.
2025DM781 (Wyandotte County, Kansas): Felix Custody, denial of access, and procedural obstruction.
2025CV325 (Wyandotte County, Kansas): Salmon v. The Layne Project, et al.—class action for coercive control, defamation, and conspiracy.
Plaintiff alleges a pattern of administrative silence, intimidation, unlawful removal from court premises, and manipulation of dockets and evidence, all in violation of federal and state law.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1367 (federal question, civil rights, supplemental jurisdiction). Venue is proper in this District because the acts and omissions occurred within Kansas and affect parties and proceedings in this jurisdiction.

III. PARTIES
Plaintiff:
Micheal Lawrence Salmon, resident of Wyandotte County, Kansas, individually and on behalf of a proposed class of similarly situated individuals.
Defendants:
Mark Dupree, Wyandotte County District Attorney (official and individual capacity)
Judge Klapper, Wyandotte County District Court (official and individual capacity)
Tina Rockley and additional Wyandotte County clerks
Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department
Olathe Police Department

IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Obstruction and Retaliation:
Plaintiff issued multiple valid subpoenas in ongoing state and class actions. No compliance or response was received from Defendants, despite statutory obligations.
Plaintiff was physically and procedurally obstructed by Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department, including threats and denial of entry to court premises.
Judicial and clerical staff, including Judge Klapper and Tina Rockley, manipulated dockets, canceled hearings without notice, and enabled ex parte concealment of filings.
Cross-Jurisdictional Suppression:
Plaintiff’s filings and emergency motions in Missouri (24SN-DR00104) and Kansas (2025DM781, 2025CV325) were ignored, denied, or actively suppressed through coordinated administrative action.
Evidence suggests ex parte communications and coordinated efforts between Kansas and Missouri court staff to suppress Plaintiff’s access to relief.
Denial of Evidence and Transparency:
Olathe Police Department refused to release body camera and dashcam footage under subpoena, improperly invoking religious exemptions and obstructing ongoing litigation.
Defendants have actively deleted, concealed, or failed to preserve critical digital evidence, risking spoliation and irreparable harm to Plaintiff’s cases.
Class-Wide Harm:
In 2025CV325, Plaintiff and a proposed class allege a pattern of coercive control, defamation, and reputational sabotage by The Layne Project, Trina Nudson, and associated parties, enabled by institutional actors and law enforcement.

V. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
COUNT I – Violation of Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. § 1983):
Defendants, acting under color of state law, deprived Plaintiff and the proposed class of due process, equal protection, and access to the courts.
COUNT II – Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. § 1985):
Defendants conspired to obstruct justice, retaliate against whistleblowing, and suppress evidence and testimony.
COUNT III – Obstruction of Justice (All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651):
Defendants’ actions constitute ongoing obstruction, necessitating federal intervention and preservation orders.
COUNT IV – Declaratory and Injunctive Relief:
Plaintiff seeks immediate injunctive relief to preserve evidence, halt further retaliation, and compel compliance with subpoenas and court orders.

VI. EMERGENCY MOTIONS AND PRESERVATION REQUESTS
Notice of Civil Rights Action and Preservation of All Writs:
All Defendants are hereby notified of the pending federal action and are ordered to preserve all emails, notes, internal communications, case files, video recordings, bodycam footage, and clerk system records associated with the following cases:
24SN-DR00104 (Missouri Stone County)
2025DM781 (Wyandotte County, Kansas)
2025CV325 (Wyandotte County, Kansas)
Motion for Preliminary Injunction:
Plaintiff moves for an order restraining Defendants from further interference, retaliation, or destruction of evidence while this action is pending.
Motion to Compel Disclosure:
Plaintiff moves for immediate release of all body-worn and dash camera footage, call logs, and incident reports from the Olathe Police Department concerning Plaintiff or Christ Connect Church for the past six (6) months.
Motion for Alternative Service:
Plaintiff requests authorization to serve Defendants by alternative means, including digital notice, social media, publication, and public posting, due to demonstrated evasion and coordinated obstruction.

VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
Accept this Petition and Complaint for filing;
Issue a preservation order for all evidence, communications, and digital records relevant to the above-captioned and related state cases;
Grant a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from further retaliation, obstruction, or destruction of evidence;
Compel immediate production of subpoenaed records and footage;
Approve alternative service methods as detailed above;
Permit Plaintiff to amend and supplement this Petition post-discovery for class certification and further relief;
Award declaratory and monetary relief as appropriate;

  content: `Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, respectfully moves this Court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915, and in support states as follows:
Plaintiff is unable to pay the costs of these proceedings due to financial hardship. Plaintiff’s income is insufficient to cover the filing fee and necessary living expenses.
Plaintiff’s affidavit of financial status is submitted herewith, setting forth all sources of income, assets, and liabilities, as required by law.
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges ongoing violations of civil rights, due process, and access to the courts, as detailed in the accompanying complaint and emergency motions.
Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court grant this motion and allow this action to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs, and for such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays the Court grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and accept the complaint for filing without prepayment of the filing fee.


Statement of Financial Status in Support of Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis
I, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, submit this statement in support of my Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis:
Employment and Income:
I am currently employed full-time at SalmonAudit.info. However, due to the ongoing deprivation of my rights and the retaliatory actions described in my complaint, I have suffered significant financial hardship. My current income is insufficient to meet my basic needs and to pay the court’s filing fee.
Supplemental Work:
In addition to my primary employment, I perform part-time gig work, including food delivery for DoorDash. This supplemental work is necessary to cover essential expenses such as food and bills.
Financial Hardship:
These circumstances have persisted for approximately seven months. During this period, my ability to earn and maintain savings has been severely impacted. I am currently relying on my remaining savings, which are being rapidly depleted to cover basic living expenses.
Inability to Pay Filing Fee:
Given my current financial situation, I am unable to pay the $405 filing fee without sacrificing essential needs. I respectfully request that the Court grant my motion to proceed in forma pauperis so that I may pursue this action for damages and relief.

  status: "Pending",
  content: `VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
AND EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, a resident of Kansas, is a judicial auditor and public interest advocate focused on exposing systemic misconduct in state courts, particularly in Missouri.


Plaintiff brings this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of a contempt order and associated capias warrant issued by the Circuit Court of Stone County, Missouri (Case No. 24SN-DR00104), which orders Plaintiff incarcerated for thirty (30) days for alleged criminal contempt.


Plaintiff asserts that the underlying order and enforcement mechanisms violate his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and seeks emergency relief to prevent irreparable harm.



JURISDICTION AND VENUE
This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343, as this action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including 42 U.S.C. § 1983.


Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred within this District and in Missouri, and because Plaintiff resides in this District.



PARTIES
Plaintiff: Micheal Lawrence Salmon, an individual residing in Kansas and engaged in constitutionally protected public interest reporting and auditing of the judiciary.


Defendant Judge: MATT ALAN SELBY, a state Circuit Judge in Stone County, Missouri, acting under color of state law and sued in official capacity.


Defendant Stone County: A political subdivision of the State of Missouri responsible for law enforcement and administration of court orders.


Defendant Sheriff: Sheriff of Stone County, Missouri, responsible for executing court-issued warrants, sued in official capacity.



FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Plaintiff documents and reports on judicial irregularities, including constitutional and procedural violations in Missouri courts.


On April 28, 2025, the Stone County Circuit Court issued an order demanding the removal of Plaintiff’s videos documenting judicial proceedings from online platforms.


On May 9, 2025, a contempt hearing was scheduled. Two days prior, Plaintiff’s authorized WebEx access was unilaterally canceled, and no alternative means of participation were provided despite Plaintiff residing in Kansas and asserting his inability to attend in person.


The court proceeded with the hearing in absentia and, on May 22, 2025, issued a Commitment Order and Capias Warrant (Exhibit A), finding Plaintiff in criminal contempt for alleged noncompliance with the April 28 order and nonappearance.


Plaintiff was not given telephonic, email, or written notice of the access changes and was denied the opportunity to present a defense.


Plaintiff made substantial efforts to comply with the underlying order, including the removal or de-indexing of content within his control, but was unable to remove materials reposted by third parties beyond his control.


The contempt order imposes incarceration without a hearing or due process, violating clearly established rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.


The order’s demand that Plaintiff remove videos critical of judicial behavior constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint and viewpoint-based censorship, infringing his First Amendment rights.


The threat of immediate arrest has chilled Plaintiff’s constitutionally protected speech and obstructed his public interest investigations, which involve documenting systemic access denials in multiple Missouri courtrooms.


Defendants acted under color of state law and in disregard of clearly established constitutional rights.


Plaintiff has exhausted state remedies including appeals and writ filings, but the contempt order remains active and enforceable.


Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law and faces imminent and irreparable harm absent emergency relief from this Court.



CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
Count I – Violation of Due Process
(14th Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983)
Plaintiff realleges all preceding paragraphs.


Defendants violated Plaintiff’s procedural due process rights by:


a. Canceling remote hearing access without notice or alternative;
b. Proceeding in absentia without ensuring the opportunity to be heard;
c. Issuing an incarceration order without proper service, participation, or evidentiary hearing.
These actions contravene clearly established due process protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.



Count II – First Amendment Violation: Prior Restraint and Viewpoint Discrimination
(1st Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983)
Plaintiff realleges all preceding paragraphs.


Defendants’ April 28 order and subsequent contempt enforcement constitute unlawful prior restraint and retaliation against Plaintiff’s constitutionally protected speech.


Defendants targeted Plaintiff’s speech due to its critical content concerning judicial conduct, amounting to viewpoint discrimination and unconstitutional censorship.



Count III – Declaratory Judgment
(28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202)
Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the contempt order and capias warrant are unconstitutional on their face and as applied.



Count IV – Injunctive Relief
(Fed. R. Civ. P. 65)
Plaintiff seeks immediate and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the enforcement of the contempt order and capias warrant to prevent irreparable constitutional harm.



EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all allegations set forth above.


Pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff requests that the Court issue a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction:


a. Enjoining enforcement of the May 22, 2025 Commitment Order and capias warrant;
b. Restraining Defendants from arresting or detaining Plaintiff pursuant to the contempt order;
c. Preserving Plaintiff’s right to publish and disseminate information related to judicial accountability;
d. Requiring Defendants to show cause why preliminary relief should not be made permanent.
Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits, has no adequate remedy at law, and faces imminent irreparable harm. The balance of equities and public interest overwhelmingly favor protection of fundamental constitutional rights.



PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Issue an Emergency Temporary Restraining Order enjoining Defendants from enforcing the May 22, 2025 contempt order and capias warrant;
B. Set a prompt hearing on the request for preliminary injunction;
C. Declare that the contempt order and associated enforcement violate Plaintiff’s constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments;
D. Permanently enjoin Defendants from enforcing the contempt order or capias warrant;
E. Award Plaintiff costs and, if applicable, reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988;
F. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respondent.

ORDER FOR COMMITMENT  
NOW on this12.._ day of May, 2025, the Court's Order for Respondent Micheal  Salmon to appear and show cause why he should not be held in contempt for having violated the  Court's order of April 28, 2025, to immediately remove video recordings of confidential  judicial proceedings, having been heard on May 9, 2025 and taken under advisement as more  specifically set forth in the Judgment of Contempt filed contemporaneously herewith, this cause  
is taken from under advisement and the Court finds that:  
1. Local court rule prohibits the recording of judicial proceedings in the 39th Judicial Circuit. 2. Paternity actions are confidential proceedings by the Revised Statutes of Missouri, section 210.846. 
3. This Court did not consent to the recording or dissemination of any recordings of any hearing in this paternity case. 
4. The Respondent recorded multiple court hearings without permission of the Court and published at least some of those recordings to the public. 
5. The Respondent had actual knowledge of the Court's order of April 29, 2025, to immediately remove the videos of the confidential court proceedings from all social media locations where it had been posted. 
6. Respondent willfully, intentionally and contumaciously refused to comply with the Court's order of April 29, 2025, as evidenced by his various court filings and the evidence 
presented at the May 9, 2025 trial and hearings, specifically: 
FILED  
CIRCUIT COURT  
MAY 2 2 2025  
STONE COUNTY 
a. Respondent willfully disobeyed the order of this court by not removing all videos of court proceedings immediately; and 
b. Respondent had notice of the Court's order to remove the videos; and c. Respondent understood the Court's order of April 29, 2025; and 
d. Respondent was able to comply with the Court's order and intentionally chose not 
to comply with the order. 
e. Respondent posted additional videos of confidential court proceedings after the Court's order of April 29, 2025. 
7. The Respondent had adequate notice that on May 9, 2025, a hearing would be held to determine if Respondent should be held in contempt for refusing to comply with the court's April 29, 2025 order, and clearly, based on Respondent's subsequent filings, had knowledge of the essential facts upon which he was being accused of contempt. 
8.

  title: "TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE",
  date: "2025-05-23",
  type: "Order",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
Plaintiff Micheal Lawrence Salmon, proceeding pro se, has moved for a Temporary Restraining Order pursuant to Rule 65(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Having reviewed the Verified Complaint, supporting declaration, and memorandum in support of emergency relief, the Court finds:
1. Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his constitutional claims under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments;
2. Plaintiff faces immediate and irreparable injury in the form of unlawful arrest, incarceration, and deprivation of fundamental rights without due process;
3. The balance of equities favors the Plaintiff, as Defendants will suffer no injury from a temporary restraint;
4. The public interest is served by enforcement of constitutional protections and judicial accountability.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
1. That Defendants, including any agents of the Stone County Circuit Court, the Stone County Sheriff's Office, or any other Missouri agency, are TEMPORARILY RESTRAINED from enforcing or executing the "Order for Commitment" entered in Case No. 24SN-DR00104 or any related capias warrant against Micheal Lawrence Salmon;
2. That Defendants shall SHOW CAUSE in writing on or before [insert date 10 days from entry] why a preliminary injunction should not issue;
3. That this Temporary Restraining Order shall remain in effect for fourteen (14) days from the date of entry, unless extended for good cause shown, or by agreement of the parties.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

NOTICE OF RELATED STATE COURT PROCEEDINGS
Plaintiff Micheal Lawrence Salmon hereby gives notice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 and Local Rule 3.2 of the following ongoing state court proceedings which are directly related to the facts and relief sought in this federal action:
1. **Missouri Case No. 24SN-DR00104**  
   Court: Stone County Circuit Court (Missouri)  
   Nature: Family law custody matter. Subject of unconstitutional "Order for Commitment" and arrest warrant issued without hearing.  
   Status: Appeal, Writ of Mandamus, and Judicial Discipline Letter pending.
2. **Kansas Case No. 2025DM781**  
   Court: District Court of Johnson County, Kansas  
   Nature: Ongoing custody proceedings involving same parties. This case was moved from Missouri jurisdiction.  
   Status: Emergency hearing held May 21, 2025; constitutional violations from Missouri proceedings actively referenced.
3. **Kansas Case No. WY2025LM002787**  
   Court: Wyandotte County District Court  
   Nature: Eviction proceeding involving overlapping parties and alleged retaliatory conduct designed to undermine custody jurisdiction.
Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement this Notice as additional related matters develop. These proceedings are introduced to assist the Court in understanding the ongoing, multi-jurisdictional nature of the coercive and unconstitutional conduct at issue.
ORDER PROTECTING PLAINTIFF'S RIGHT TO RECORD, DOCUMENT, AND PUBLISH PUBLIC PROCEEDINGS
This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiff’s request for an order affirming his constitutional right to record and publish material involving public actors, court proceedings, and governmental conduct, which Plaintiff asserts is essential for his safety and necessary to document a pattern of systemic abuse.
Having reviewed the Verified Complaint and supporting materials, and recognizing the public interest in transparency and First Amendment protections, the Court hereby FINDS:
1. Plaintiff is engaged in protected First Amendment activity, including the right to record, document, and publish governmental proceedings and public events, particularly those involving alleged constitutional violations;
2. Plaintiff has alleged a sustained pattern of governmental targeting and coercion that elevates the need for documentation as a form of self-defense and evidence preservation;
3. Plaintiff has incorporated automated publication tools and artificial intelligence-based systems that may publicly disseminate materials without continuous direct control;
4. Any attempt to hold Plaintiff in contempt or retaliate for such publication—particularly where there is no direct or knowing intent—would chill constitutionally protected expression and pose an undue risk of further rights violations.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
1. Plaintiff shall not be sanctioned, detained, or held in contempt of court in any jurisdiction solely for recording, documenting, or publishing material related to this or related proceedings, especially when such publication results from automated tools or third-party platforms outside Plaintiff’s direct control.
2. Government officials and court actors are enjoined from using contempt powers, gag orders, or collateral retaliatory actions to suppress such activity, unless narrowly tailored and subject to this Court’s review.
3. This Order is without prejudice to any party seeking a future clarification of publication boundaries, but no such request shall justify suppression of public interest reporting or documentation of official conduct without strict scrutiny.
IT IS SO ORDERED.`

  title: "PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DECLARE MISSOURI ORDERS VOID FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION AND TO ENJOIN UNLAWFUL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS",
  date: "2025-05-23",
  type: "Motion",
  status: "Pending",
  content: `PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DECLARE MISSOURI ORDERS VOID FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION AND TO ENJOIN UNLAWFUL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS
COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court for declaratory and injunctive relief to declare orders issued by Stone County, Missouri—including any warrants or contempt actions—as void ab initio due to lack of personal and subject-matter jurisdiction, and to enjoin any further enforcement thereof.
I. NO JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFF EXISTED AT TIME OF ORDERS
At all relevant times, Plaintiff was neither domiciled in nor present within the State of Missouri. Plaintiff did not appear in any hearing, did not consent to Missouri jurisdiction, and was not properly served. Missouri courts therefore lacked both **personal** and **subject-matter** jurisdiction to issue any enforceable custody or contempt order against him.
Plaintiff’s residence has remained continuously in Kansas since his relocation. Under well-established federal and constitutional law, **a court cannot impose binding legal obligations on a non-consenting, non-resident party without proper service and jurisdiction**. *Burnham v. Superior Court*, 495 U.S. 604 (1990); *Kulko v. California Superior Court*, 436 U.S. 84 (1978).
II. MISSOURI LOST SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION UNDER UCCJEA
Missouri's own statutory regime—the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)—mandates that jurisdiction over custody transfers to the "home state" where the child and both parents now reside. That home state is now Kansas.
Per Mo. Rev. Stat. § 452.750, Missouri’s continuing jurisdiction was terminated once both parents and the child ceased residing in the state. The Stone County Court never formally relinquished jurisdiction, but it ceased to exist by operation of law.
III. STONE COUNTY’S ORDERS ARE VOID AB INITIO
Because Stone County lacked both personal and subject-matter jurisdiction, all orders and warrants issued against Plaintiff are void. See *United States v. Bigford*, 365 F.3d 859 (10th Cir. 2004) (“A void order is one that is a nullity from the outset and has no legal effect.”).
Void orders cannot be enforced and cannot form the basis for contempt, arrest, or denial of custody rights. Yet these orders have been systematically used to deprive Plaintiff of constitutional rights—including access to his child—without due process.
IV. ONGOING HARM AND NEED FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Plaintiff is currently facing repeated threats of arrest and loss of parental access based solely on unlawful Missouri actions. The existence of an unenforceable warrant—issued absent jurisdiction—has become a tool of coercion and psychological warfare. Plaintiff has documented a pattern of judicial retaliation, procedural obstruction, and coordinated legal abuse.
Immediate federal protection is required to prevent further violations of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and to preserve the integrity of concurrent Kansas proceedings.

V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
1. DECLARE that Stone County, Missouri lacked jurisdiction to issue any orders or warrants against Plaintiff;
2. DECLARE that such orders are void ab initio and legally unenforceable;
3. ISSUE a preliminary and permanent injunction against enforcement of any Missouri contempt actions or warrants against Plaintiff;
4. ORDER any Missouri-based Defendant(s) to cease reliance on void orders for custody or criminal matters;
5. AWARD such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

  content: `Writ of Federal Protection (Provisional Habeas Logic)
Petition for Provisional Writ of Habeas Corpus and Federal Protective Relief
Citing Exhaustion Futility Due to State Fraud (28 U.S.C. § 2241)
Plaintiff respectfully petitions this Court for a provisional writ of federal protection, invoking habeas corpus logic under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, based on the futility of further state remedies due to documented systemic fraud and deprivation of federal rights.
Legal Basis and Context
28 U.S.C. § 2241 authorizes federal courts to grant habeas relief to individuals in custody in violation of the Constitution or federal law, and is available in exceptional circumstances where state remedies are ineffective or unavailable due to obstruction, fraud, or bad faith by state actors.
The exhaustion requirement for state remedies may be excused where further pursuit would be futile, especially when the state process itself is tainted by fraud, bias, or ongoing violations of fundamental rights (see Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972) – pro se complaints must be liberally construed and not dismissed without opportunity to present evidence of rights violations; Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991) – courts have inherent power to sanction bad-faith litigation conduct that abuses the judicial process)1.
In this matter, Plaintiff has made repeated attempts to obtain relief in Kansas District Court Case 2025DM781, but state proceedings have been irreparably compromised by:
Systemic fraud on the court, including perjury and destruction of records (see HOKUWA-O001, O015; HOKUWA-C005, C006)1.
Judicial bias, refusal to correct errors, and denial of due process (see HOKUWA-J003, J022, J026)1.
Retaliation against whistleblowers and obstruction of federal rights.`

  content: `Exhaustion Futility Argument
The Supreme Court recognizes that exhaustion of state remedies is not required where such efforts would be futile or where the process is rendered ineffective by state misconduct (see Haines v. Kerner; Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.)1.
Plaintiff’s documented evidence establishes that further state court actions would not provide an adequate or fair opportunity for relief, and that continued state proceedings would only perpetuate irreparable harm and denial of federal rights.
Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
Issue a provisional writ of federal protection, enjoining enforcement of all state orders arising from tainted proceedings in Case 2025DM781.
Grant immediate access to the minor child, Felix, pending full federal review.
Order preservation of all relevant records and evidence.
Set this matter for expedited hearing and grant such further relief as justice requires.

Emergency Demand Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Illegal Deprivation of Parental Rights, Retaliatory Policing, and Systemic Due Process Violations (Felix Salmon, Case 2025DM781)

I. INTRODUCTION
For 167 days as of May 27, 2025, I have been unlawfully barred from all contact with my son, Felix Salmon, due to a coordinated campaign involving:
Fraudulent court orders: An uncertified Missouri no-contact order misapplied in Kansas.
Judicial retaliation: Actions taken in Stone County Circuit Court Case No. [REDACTED].
Collusion between law enforcement and Respondent: Documented in Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Incident Report #SM-AUDIT-05272025-001.
No court date has been set, and I have received no response from the court or opposing parties to my repeated requests for hearing or clarification. I am unable to obtain a complete, accurate copy of the docket despite multiple formal requests.
These actions constitute a flagrant violation of my Fourteenth Amendment rights and necessitate immediate federal intervention under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act. All primary evidence and incident logs are maintained and available at SalmonAudit.info.

II. INCIDENT SUMMARY (MAY 27, 2025)
At approximately 10:15 AM CST on May 27, 2025, I attempted to verify Felix’s safety at Crycella Freitag’s mother's residence (Kansas City, KS). Despite:
No valid Kansas custody order presented;
No domestic violence allegations or adjudicated risks;
Documented compliance with all prior court requests (SalmonAudit: Timestamped communications);
Wyandotte County officers threatened arrest, citing a void Missouri no-contact order (Order lacks Kansas certification under K.S.A. 60-3106). Bodycam footage (requested for preservation) captures officers stating: SGT Tanner Hendrickson and Jesse Vega.
“We know this is a Missouri order, but we’re enforcing it anyway.”
“We know this order isn’t Kansas certified/adjusted, but we’re enforcing it still ”
This mirrors prior incidents (HOKUWA-L003, L005) where law enforcement refused to verify order validity.

III. SYSTEMIC CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
A. Judicial Misconduct (Stone County Circuit Court)
Judge Matt Alan Selby ignored 28 motions (Exhibit D: Docket Entries 14–42), including:
Emergency Motion to Enforce Visitation (March 21, 2025)
Motion to Strike Fraudulent Psychological Evaluation (April 4, 2025)
Ex parte communications with Respondent’s counsel, Josh Garrett, are evidenced in email logs.
B. Law Enforcement Collusion
Retaliatory arrests without probable cause (HOKUWA-L0281)
Selective enforcement of invalid orders
C. Parental Alienation
Respondent blocked all contact

IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR FEDERAL INTERVENTION
A. 42 U.S.C. § 1983: Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law
B. Fourteenth Amendment: Arbitrary Denial of Parenting Time (Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57)
C. Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (28 U.S.C. § 1738A): Invalid Out-of-State Order Enforcement
D. Obstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. § 1505): Evidence Tampering
E. Conspiracy Against Rights (18 U.S.C. § 241): Civil Rights Conspiracy

V. DEMANDED RELIEF
Emergency Injunction: Immediate restoration of parenting time; federal marshals to supervise visits pending investigation.
Preservation Orders: All bodycam and dispatch records from the May 27 incident; judicial communications between Judge Selby, Klapper, Lynch and Attorney Garrett.
Investigative Actions: DOJ review of Stone County and Wyandotte Counties pattern of bias; grand jury indictment for civil rights conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 241.
Damages: $500,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress; punitive sanctions against retaliatory actors.
Docket Access: Immediate production of a certified, complete docket for Case 25CV02276, including all filings, motions, and orders to date.

VI. URGENT REQUEST
Every hour without action inflicts irreparable harm on Felix and me. I respectfully request:
A response from the DOJ within 48 hours;
An expedited hearing in the U.S. District Court;
Confirmation that all evidence and filings listed at SalmonAudit.info are entered into the record and preserved for review.

    content: `TO THE HONORABLE COURT:\r\nI, Micheal Salmon, appearing Pro Se, respectfully move this Court to transfer venue for this\r\ncase from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience\r\nof all parties and witnesses, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a).\r\n\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis motion seeks to transfer venue to the District of Kansas, where both parties currently\r\nreside, to reduce undue burdens on the parties and ensure efficient resolution of this matter.\r\nThe current venue in Missouri imposes significant logistical and financial challenges, making it\r\nimpractical for the parties and witnesses.\r\n\r\nII. Factual Background\r\n1. Parties� Residences:\r\n? I, Micheal Salmon, reside at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas, 66103.\r\n? The Plaintiff, Crycella Freitag, resides in Pomona, Kansas.\r\n2. Current Venue Impact:\r\n? The current venue in Missouri is over four hours away from both parties� homes,\r\nmaking travel difficult.\r\n3. Efforts to Cooperate:\r\n? I relocated from Missouri to Kansas to facilitate co-parenting and reduce travel\r\nburdens, moving within 40 minutes of the Plaintiff.\r\n\r\n4. Personal and Community Ties in Kansas:\r\n? Our two-year-old son, Felix, attends a Montessori school and is actively involved\r\nin community activities in Kansas, including church and friendships.\r\n\r\n? Both families reside in Kansas, making it a more practical location for witness\r\ntestimonies.\r\n\r\n5. Financial and Work Constraints:\r\n? As a full-time single father, taking time off work to travel four hours each way for\r\ncourt proceedings is unfeasible.\r\n? The Plaintiff also works full time, making a Missouri venue equally burdensome.\r\n\r\nIII. Legal Standard\r\nUnder 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a), this Court may transfer a case for the convenience of the parties\r\nand witnesses, and in the interest of justice. Factors to consider include:\r\n1. The convenience of the parties and witnesses;\r\n2. Access to sources of proof;\r\n3. The plaintiff�s choice of forum;\r\n4. Practical challenges of conducting the trial in the chosen forum;\r\n5. Local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\r\n\r\nIV. Argument\r\n1. Convenience of the Parties:\r\n? Both parties reside in Kansas and would face significant hardship traveling to\r\nMissouri for court appearances. Transferring the case to Kansas reduces\r\nlogistical burdens for both.\r\n2. Convenience of Witnesses:\r\n? Both parties� families and potential witnesses reside in Kansas, minimizing travel\r\nfor them and ensuring better participation.\r\n\r\n3. Access to Evidence:\r\n? Relevant evidence, such as Felix�s school records and community ties, is more\r\nreadily available in Kansas.\r\n\r\n4. Local Interest:\r\n? Kansas has a strong local interest in adjudicating this matter, as both parties and\r\ntheir child reside and participate in the Kansas community.\r\n\r\n5. Interest of Justice:\r\n\r\n? Transferring the case aligns with fairness, reduces financial and logistical\r\nhardships, and supports the co-parenting relationship.\r\n\r\nV. Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons stated, I, Micheal Salmon, respectfully request that this Court transfer venue of\r\nthis case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice\r\nand for the convenience of the parties and witnesses.`

In support of this response, Respondent states as follows:\r\n1. Primary Custody:\r\nRespondent has been the primary caregiver for the minor child, Felix Salmon, for the\r\npast two years.

    status: "Pending",
    content: `Complaint Against Attorney for Professional Misconduct\r\nTo: The Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel\r\nSubject: Formal Complaint Against Joshua L. Garrett\r\nFrom: Micheal Salmon Address: 4120 Adams St, Kansas City, Kansas 66103\r\nDate: December 16, 2024\r\nIntroduction\r\nI am filing a formal complaint against attorney Joshua L. Garrett for unethical professional\r\nconduct in his representation of my ex-partner, Crycella Freitag, in our ongoing child custody\r\nmatter concerning our son, Felix Salmon.\r\nSpecific Instances of Misconduct\r\n1. Deliberate Obstruction of Co-Parenting Communication\r\nIn November 2024, Mr. Garrett advised Crycella to cease all communication with me, which\r\nresulted in:\r\n? Complete cessation of discussions about Felix's care and upbringing\r\n? Refusal to provide financial information related to our child's support\r\n? Intentional withholding of critical parenting and residential information\r\nThis advice has systematically undermined my ability to co-parent effectively and share\r\nresponsibilities for our child's well-being.\r\n2. Facilitation of Manipulative Communication Tactics\r\nFollowing Mr. Garrett's advice, our interactions have devolved into:\r\n? Intentionally confrontational exchanges\r\n? Calculated attempts to provoke or entrap me\r\n? Deliberate creation of a hostile communication environment\r\n3. Enabling False Safety Claims\r\n\r\nA particularly egregious incident occurred when Crycella claimed to feel \"unsafe\" while:\r\n? Voluntarily present in my home\r\n? Situated in my bedroom\r\n? In the presence of our children\r\nWhen I sought clarification about this sudden claim, she refused to provide any substantive\r\nexplanation. This baseless allegation appears designed to:\r\n? Damage my reputation as a parent\r\n? Undermine my relationship with our children\r\n? Weaponize unfounded safety concerns\r\n4. Pattern of Racial Weaponization\r\nThis is not an isolated incident. Previously, Crycella attempted to:\r\n? Take Felix across state lines without my knowledge or consent\r\n? Involve law enforcement with fabricated claims of danger\r\n? Leverage her position as a white woman to potentially harm my parental rights as a\r\nBlack father\r\nMr. Garrett's continued legal counsel appears to tacitly encourage and enable these harmful\r\ntactics.\r\nViolations of Professional Ethics\r\nI believe Mr. Garrett has violated multiple professional conduct rules:\r\n1. Rule 4.4 � Respect for Rights of Third Persons\r\n? Providing advice that disregards the well-being of our child\r\n? Causing significant harm to co-parental communication\r\n2. Rule 1.2 � Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority\r\n? Advising client to cease essential communication\r\n? Actions directly contrary to the best interests of the minor child\r\n3. Rule 8.4 � Misconduct\r\n? Engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice\r\n? Promoting tactics involving false allegations and manipulation\r\n\r\nImpact on Family Dynamics\r\nThe consequences of Mr. Garrett's unethical guidance include:\r\n? Emotional distress for our child, Felix\r\n\r\n? Systematic destruction of co-parental communication\r\n? Potential long-term psychological harm from persistent conflict\r\nRequested Action\r\nI formally request that the Bar Association:\r\n? Thoroughly investigate Mr. Garrett's professional conduct\r\n? Consider appropriate disciplinary measures\r\n? Mandate cessation of tactics that obstruct meaningful co-parenting\r\nConclusion\r\nAs the primary goal of any custody arrangement should be the child's best interest, Mr. Garrett's\r\nactions have systematically undermined this fundamental principle. I trust the Bar Association\r\nwill take these serious allegations seriously and take appropriate action.`

    content: `Witness Name: Jozef Hanratty\r\nAddress: 4120 Adams St, Kansas City, Kansas 66103\r\nCOMES NOW the undersigned, Jozef Hanratty, and provides this witness statement regarding\r\nthe interactions and behavior of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards Micheal Lawrence Salmon.\r\nThe following statements are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief:\r\nGaslighting Behavior\r\n1. On several occasions, I heard Crycella Elizabeth Freitag state to Micheal Lawrence\r\nSalmon:\r\n? \"You don�t have the right to know anything about me, my finances, or where I\r\nwant to take Felix.\"\r\n? \"You don�t need to know where Felix stays, and I don�t need to show you pictures\r\nof our time together.\"\r\n\r\n2. These statements were made in a dismissive and confrontational tone, seemingly\r\nintended to belittle Micheal and undermine his valid concerns about Felix's well-being.\r\nOmission of Critical Information\r\n1. Crycella Elizabeth Freitag explicitly refused to provide Micheal with vital information\r\nabout her finances and Felix�s care, stating:\r\n? \"No, until I get what I want, you won�t get any help from me.\"\r\n2. Furthermore, she accused Micheal of making her feel \"unsafe\" without providing any\r\nexplanation or justification for these claims.\r\nLying and Interruptions\r\n1. I observed Crycella frequently interrupting Micheal during discussions, accusing him of\r\nlying and refusing to listen to his responses.\r\n2. Despite these interruptions, Micheal remained calm and transparent in his\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nTransparency and Hospitality by Micheal Lawrence Salmon\r\n1. Micheal invited Crycella into his home and maintained open communication to facilitate\r\nco-parenting and transparency.\r\n2. Despite his efforts, Crycella continued her dismissive and uncooperative behavior.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on my observations, the behavior exhibited by Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards\r\nMicheal Lawrence Salmon was manipulative, dismissive, and designed to escalate tension\r\nunnecessarily. I attest to witnessing the above-described events and am prepared to provide\r\nadditional information or testimony as required.`

    content: `Witness Name: Anya Hill\r\nAddress: Resides with Crycella Freitag\r\nCOMES NOW, the undersigned, Anya Hill, and provides this witness statement regarding the\r\ninteractions and behavior of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards Micheal Lawrence Salmon, as\r\nobserved by me during the past few years. Although I am only 12 years old, I have lived with\r\nMicheal for the last seven years and have witnessed much of what has occurred. The following\r\nis true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief:\r\n1. Relationship with Micheal Lawrence Salmon:\r\n? While Micheal is not my biological father, he has been a significant figure in my\r\nlife for the last seven years. He has always been there for me in a supportive and\r\ncaring way, helping me with school, providing for me, and offering guidance when\r\nI needed it.\r\n? He has made efforts to be involved in my life, and I have always appreciated his\r\nsupport. Although I do not consider him my \"father\" in the legal sense, I do see\r\nhim as a positive male role model and someone who has always treated me with\r\nkindness and respect.\r\n\r\n2. Observations of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag:\r\n? I have noticed that Crycella frequently speaks negatively about Todd Hill, my\r\nbiological father, in front of me. This makes me uncomfortable, as it seems like\r\nshe is trying to turn me against him. I don�t like hearing these comments, as they\r\nonly make me feel conflicted and upset.\r\n? Crycella has also discouraged me from having a positive relationship with\r\nMicheal, even though he has always treated me well. On several occasions, she\r\nhas dismissed my feelings when I express how much I appreciate Micheal�s\r\nsupport in my life.\r\n\r\n3. Disagreement and Combative Behavior:\r\n? Crycella often becomes combative when I express positive things about Micheal,\r\nwhich makes me feel like I can�t talk freely about my own experiences. If I\r\nmention that I feel comfortable with him or that he has been helpful to me, she\r\ngets upset and tries to change the subject or criticize him.\r\n\r\n? This has made it difficult for me to maintain a healthy and open relationship with\r\nMicheal. I know he has always been there for me, but Crycella�s behavior\r\ninterferes with that.\r\n\r\n4. The Role of Micheal Lawrence Salmon in My Life:\r\n? While he is not my legal father, Micheal has always been there to offer support\r\nand care. He�s made sure I had what I needed, and he has been involved in my\r\nlife when I needed him. He has helped me with schoolwork, been present for\r\nimportant events, and has always shown me kindness.\r\n? I wish I could see Micheal more often and without Crycella�s interference. He has\r\nalways tried to be a positive influence in my life, and I believe he cares for me,\r\neven though we don�t have a traditional father-daughter relationship.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nBased on my observations, Micheal has been a caring and supportive person in my life.\r\nCrycella�s behavior has often made it difficult for me to maintain a positive relationship with him,\r\nand I believe that her treatment of him has been unfair. Additionally, I feel uncomfortable with\r\nthe negative things she says about my biological father, Todd Hill, as it has created unnecessary\r\ntension. I wish that I could freely express my feelings without fear of upsetting Crycella.`

    content: `PARENTING TIME LOG\r\nDate: Thursday, December 26, 2024\r\nInteraction:\r\n? Asked Crycella when she would like to see Felix again. After three hours of arguing, she\r\nchose Saturday but refused to provide an itinerary.\r\n? Expressed concerns regarding supervision and requested a chaperone for future visits\r\ndue to a prior incident where Felix returned cold and shaking after being outside for over\r\nfour hours in inappropriate clothing. Crycella refused to agree to any supervision or\r\nprovide photos of Felix at events.\r\nDate: Friday, December 27, 2024\r\nInteraction:\r\n? Received no updates from Crycella regarding Saturday plans as promised.\r\nDate: Saturday, December 28, 2024\r\nInteraction:\r\n? 8:00 AM: Contacted Crycella to confirm her plans to see Felix. She stated she still had\r\nno specific plans and could not provide any details.\r\n? 8:30 AM: Informed Crycella she could have Felix from 3:00 PM until bedtime and\r\nexplained that if she did not show up, it would be her responsibility. She agreed to this\r\narrangement and again told me it was because of her broken car.\r\nImpact:\r\n1. Lost opportunity for personal time with friends due to last-minute planning changes.\r\n2. Missed potential side jobs, resulting in lost income opportunities critical as a single\r\nfather.\r\n3. Created unnecessary stress and uncertainty for Felix due to Crycella�s lack of reliability.\r\nConclusion\r\nCrycella�s repeated failure to provide clear plans and her reliance on transportation issues as an\r\nexcuse has significantly impacted my ability to plan my life and care for Felix. Her inconsistent\r\nvisitation and lack of accountability place undue strain on me as a single father and affect Felix�s\r\nemotional well-being.\r\n\r\nI am prepared to provide further details or testimony to support this log.`

In support of\r\nthis motion, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n1.

Judge Selby has allowed knowingly false testimony from witnesses, affecting the\r\nfairness of the custody proceedings.\r\n3. Judge Selby�s failure to consider relevant evidence has led to an unjust ruling that is not\r\nin the best interest of the minor child.\r\n4.

In support of this Motion, Respondent states as follows:\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis Motion is brought to ensure the welfare and safety of Felix Salmon by establishing clear\r\ncommunication protocols between the parties regarding his care, health, and activities during\r\nPetitioner�s parenting time.\r\nII. Factual Basis\r\n1. Failure to Provide Necessary Information\r\n? During Felix�s recent visit with Petitioner, he returned to Respondent exhibiting\r\nsymptoms of vomiting and illness. When asked about his diet and activities,\r\nPetitioner refused to disclose any relevant information, hindering Respondent�s\r\nability to provide appropriate care and treatment.\r\n\r\n2. Ongoing Communication Issues\r\n? Petitioner has consistently refused to communicate effectively or provide timely\r\nand accurate information regarding Felix�s well-being. This includes:\r\n? Failing to notify Respondent of activities or locations during her parenting\r\ntime.\r\n? Refusing to answer questions regarding Felix�s diet, health, or exposure\r\nto unsafe environments.\r\n? Creating unnecessary stress and instability for Felix due to lack of\r\ncooperation and transparency.\r\n3. Pattern of Neglect and Poor Co-Parenting\r\n? As outlined in Respondent�s prior Motion for Supervised Visitation, Petitioner�s\r\nbehavior demonstrates a pattern of neglect and poor judgment, including:\r\n? Failing to provide adequate clothing during outings in freezing weather.\r\n? Exposing Felix to unsafe living conditions and toxic family dynamics.\r\n\r\n4. Impact on Felix�s Well-Being\r\n\r\n? The lack of communication directly impacts Felix�s health and emotional stability,\r\nas Respondent is unable to make informed decisions regarding his care when\r\nnecessary details are withheld.\r\n\r\nIII. Legal Basis\r\nMissouri law emphasizes the importance of cooperative co-parenting and prioritizing the child�s\r\nbest interests in custody and visitation matters. A communication order is essential to ensure\r\nboth parties can fulfill their parental responsibilities effectively.\r\nIV. Requested Relief\r\nWHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court:\r\n1. Order both parties to communicate promptly and effectively regarding:\r\n? Felix�s health, diet, and activities during parenting time.\r\n? Any incidents, injuries, or illnesses occurring while Felix is in the care of either\r\nparty.\r\n? Specific times and locations for pick-up and drop-off to ensure consistency.\r\n2. Require Petitioner to respond to inquiries about Felix�s care within a reasonable\r\ntimeframe (e.g., 24 hours).\r\n3. Impose penalties for non-compliance, including but not limited to:\r\n? Financial penalties for failure to communicate as ordered.\r\n? Further restrictions on parenting time if non-compliance continues.\r\n4. Grant any other relief this Court deems just and proper to protect Felix�s best interests.\r\nV. Supporting Exhibits\r\nRespondent incorporates by reference all exhibits previously submitted in the Motion for\r\nSupervised Visitation, including:\r\n? Exhibit A: Text messages and documentation regarding Petitioner�s refusal to\r\ncommunicate.\r\n? Exhibit B: Evidence of prior incidents affecting Felix�s health and well-being.`

    content: `COMES NOW Micheal Lawrence Salmon (\"Respondent\") and respectfully moves this Court to\r\ngrant emergency relief requiring that all visitation between Crycella Elizabeth Freitag\r\n(\"Petitioner\") and the minor child, Felix Salmon, be supervised by Respondent until further order\r\nof the Court. This request is made to protect the health, safety, and well-being of Felix Salmon in\r\nlight of repeated incidents demonstrating a lack of appropriate care by Petitioner. In support of\r\nthis Motion, Respondent states as follows:\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis Motion is brought pursuant to Missouri law, which authorizes the Court to take emergency\r\nmeasures to safeguard the welfare of a minor child. The relief requested herein is necessary to\r\naddress ongoing concerns about Petitioner�s ability to provide a safe and stable environment for\r\nFelix Salmon.\r\nII. Factual Basis\r\n1. Recent Incident of Illness After Visitation\r\n? On January 7, 2025, Felix returned from visitation with Petitioner exhibiting\r\nsymptoms of vomiting and illness.\r\n? When Respondent inquired about Felix�s diet and activities during the visit,\r\nPetitioner refused to provide any information, hindering Respondent�s ability to\r\nensure appropriate medical care and determine the cause of the illness.\r\n\r\n2. History of Unsafe Practices\r\n? As outlined in Respondent�s prior Motion for Supervised Visitation, Petitioner has\r\nengaged in a pattern of neglect and poor judgment, including:\r\n? Failing to dress Felix appropriately for freezing weather during a zoo visit,\r\nresulting in symptoms of hypothermia.\r\n?

Refusal to Communicate\r\n\r\n? Petitioner routinely refuses to share essential information about Felix�s health,\r\ndiet, and activities during her parenting time, creating significant risks to Felix�s\r\nwell-being.\r\n\r\n4.

    content: `TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE COURT:\r\nComes now Micheal Lawrence Salmon, the Plaintiff, and respectfully moves this Court to\r\nimmediately retract and modify the custody order entered on December 3, 2024 due to\r\nfraudulent testimony, procedural misconduct, and unethical legal tactics that have caused\r\nsubstantial and unjust harm. Plaintiff further requests this Court impose sanctions against\r\nDefendant Joshua Garrett for his deliberate role in misleading the Court and obstructing justice.\r\nIn support of this motion, Plaintiff states as follows:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nPlaintiff has been subjected to fraudulent testimony and unethical legal maneuvers that have\r\ndeprived him of his parental rights and inflicted significant financial and emotional harm. This\r\nmotion seeks urgent relief by requesting the immediate reversal of the unjust custody order and\r\nfinancial sanctions against Defendant Joshua Garrett for his misconduct in these proceedings.\r\nFurthermore, Plaintiff explicitly informed Judge Matt Alan Selby during the hearing that he\r\npossessed a contradictory lease agreement and supporting text messages disproving the false\r\nclaims made by Defendants. However, Judge Selby refused to review this evidence, thereby\r\nrendering a decision based on knowingly incomplete and misleading testimony.\r\n\r\nGROUNDS FOR RELIEF\r\nA. FRAUDULENT TESTIMONY AND MISREPRESENTATION OF LIVING SITUATION\r\n1. Jozef Hanratty falsely testified that Plaintiff was an unfit parent despite only knowing\r\nPlaintiff for 30 days.\r\n2. Hanratty admitted under oath to harassing Plaintiff and interfering with his custody,\r\nyet the Court still allowed his testimony to dictate custody arrangements.\r\n\r\n3. Court filings falsely described Plaintiff as \"homeless\" despite Plaintiff having a valid lease\r\nagreement and multiple stable housing options.\r\n4. Plaintiff attempted to present his lease agreement and supporting text messages to\r\nJudge Matt Alan Selby, who refused to review the documents, leading to an unfair and\r\nunfounded ruling.\r\nB. UNETHICAL CONDUCT AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE BY JOSHUA GARRETT\r\n1. Joshua Garrett knowingly presented false and misleading testimony to the Court, failing\r\nin his duty as an officer of the Court.\r\n2. Garrett conspired with Jozef Hanratty and Crycella Freitag to fabricate a crisis, leading to\r\nan emergency custody order on December 3, 2024, based on false pretenses.\r\n3. Garrett deliberately obstructed Plaintiff�s ability to respond to legal actions by refusing to\r\ncommunicate via email and relying on postal mail to delay essential court\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n4. Garrett actively pressured Plaintiff�s landlord to remove him from his residence,\r\nmanufacturing instability to be used against Plaintiff in custody proceedings.\r\nC. COORDINATED INTERFERENCE AND MALICIOUS LITIGATION\r\n1. Defendants colluded to manipulate custody proceedings through perjury and falsified\r\nclaims, directly harming Plaintiff�s parental rights.\r\n2. As a result of Defendants� fraudulent actions, Plaintiff has suffered:\r\n? Unjustified loss of custody and parental time.\r\n? Severe financial hardship, including loss of internet access essential for work\r\nand legal proceedings.\r\n? Emotional distress due to the disruption of his child�s well-being and false\r\nallegations against him.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED RELIEF\r\nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:\r\n1. Immediately vacate and modify the custody order based on the fraudulent testimony and\r\nmisrepresentation of facts.\r\n2. Grant primary custody to Plaintiff, as it is in the best interest of the child and necessary\r\nto rectify the injustice caused by Defendants� fraudulent conduct.\r\n3. Conduct a new custody evaluation or hearing to properly assess the current\r\ncircumstances, ensuring a fair and unbiased review.\r\n4. Impose financial sanctions on Joshua Garrett for his unethical conduct and deliberate\r\ninterference in Plaintiff�s custody rights.\r\n5. Order Crycella Freitag and Joshua Garrett to reimburse Plaintiff for legal expenses and\r\nfinancial damages incurred due to their fraudulent actions.\r\n\r\n6. Disqualify Joshua Garrett from further representing Crycella Freitag due to his pattern of\r\nunethical behavior.\r\n7. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.`

    status: "Pending",
    content: `To Whom It May Concern,\r\nI am submitting this formal complaint against Elizabeth Lacy, Domestic Clerk of the Stone\r\nCounty Circuit Court, regarding her deliberate obstruction of my appeal process in case\r\n24SN-DR00104. The actions taken by Ms. Lacy violate Missouri Supreme Court Rule 81.12,\r\nimpede my due process rights, and create an unlawful financial barrier to my ability to appeal.\r\nSpecific Allegations of Misconduct\r\n1. Misrepresentation of Appellate Record Requirements\r\nMissouri Rule 81.12(a) and (c) states that an appellant may submit a statement of evidence in\r\nlieu of a full transcript when the cost is prohibitive. However, Ms. Lacy falsely stated that I am\r\nrequired to pay for the entire transcript and cannot submit a partial record. This is a blatant\r\nmisrepresentation of the rule and an attempt to obstruct my access to the appeals process.\r\n2. Financially Obstructing My Right to Appeal\r\nMs. Lacy has created an artificial financial barrier to my appeal by:\r\n? Falsely stating that I must pay for a full transcript at an inflated rate ($3.50 per page,\r\ntotaling over $1,000) despite the availability of alternative means under Rule 81.12(c).\r\n? Demanding an uncertain \"deposit\" without disclosing how final costs are determined,\r\nmaking it impossible to budget or plan for the appeal.\r\n? Withholding information on cost waivers and alternative documentation that could allow\r\nme to proceed without an excessive financial burden.\r\nThese actions directly contradict Missouri�s established appellate procedures and constitute an\r\nabuse of administrative discretion.\r\n3. Improper Handling of My Appeal Filing\r\n? Ms. Lacy has delayed and obstructed my appeal by failing to promptly process my\r\nNotice of Appeal and attaching unnecessary financial conditions before forwarding my\r\ncase to the Missouri Court of Appeals.\r\n? She has refused to provide clear guidance on the accepted means of payment for the\r\nappeal filing fee, further delaying my ability to move forward.\r\n4. Acting Outside the Scope of Her Duties\r\nThe role of a clerk is ministerial�meaning clerks must process filings according to procedural\r\nrules without imposing additional conditions that are not required by law. Ms. Lacy is\r\n\r\nimproperly inserting herself into judicial decision-making by wrongfully interpreting appellate\r\nrules and creating conditions that prevent me from filing in a fair and timely manner.\r\nRequested Actions & Remedies\r\nGiven the above violations, I request the following:\r\n1. A formal investigation into Ms. Lacy�s conduct, including a review of whether she\r\nhas similarly obstructed other pro se litigants.\r\n2. Immediate processing of my Notice of Appeal without unlawful financial barriers.\r\n3. Clarification on the use of a Statement of Evidence in lieu of a transcript, per Rule\r\n81.12(c), to ensure compliance with appellate procedures.\r\n4. Disciplinary action against Ms. Lacy for administrative misconduct if it is found that\r\nshe has intentionally misrepresented legal requirements.\r\nFailure to address this misconduct will leave me with no choice but to escalate this matter to\r\nhigher judicial oversight bodies, including the Missouri Commission on Retirement,\r\nRemoval, and Discipline of Judges, and to pursue legal remedies to enforce my right to due\r\nprocess.\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request a written response detailing the\r\nsteps being taken to address these concerns.`

    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Salmon, Petitioner, and submits the following evidence and motion to formally tie Kelly Truelove to the present case, document procedural manipulation, and highlight judicial oversight regarding perjury committed by Jozef Hanratty and Attorney Joshua Garrett. In support of this motion, Petitioner states as follows: 1. Evidence Submission: Notice to Pay or Quit from Kelly Truelove ● Petitioner received a "Notice to Pay or Quit for Non-Payment of Rent" from Kelly's legal counsel. ● This notice is the first form of communication received from her, despite Petitioner's multiple attempts to arrange payment, which have been systematically obstructed. ● The notice states that April will be the final month of tenancy but fails to specify the exact amount owed, demonstrating bad-faith intent rather than an attempt to resolve the matter. ● The notice also declares that legal action will begin on April 1st, aligning with Petitioner's preparation to file in Kansas, where proper jurisdiction exists. 2. Procedural Manipulation and Inclusion of Kelly Truelove ● Kelly Truelove has intentionally delayed communications and manipulated circumstances to gain an unfair advantage in litigation. ● Given that housing and financial stability are directly relevant to this custody case, her involvement is critical and should be officially acknowledged by the court. ● The court should note her role in strategically delaying payments and controlling financial leverage to influence ongoing legal proceedings unfairly.  3. Judicial Error & Perjury by Jozef Hanratty and Joshua Garrett ● Jozef Hanratty provided knowingly false testimony, which has been acknowledged as false by the court but was still used to justify an unfavorable temporary order. ● Attorney Joshua Garrett has facilitated this perjury and has misrepresented facts before the court. ● The judge’s failure to act on this perjury while continuing to enforce orders based on knowingly false testimony constitutes a clear legal oversight and miscarriage of justice. ● Petitioner requests that the court formally address these infractions and reconsider rulings that have been improperly influenced by false testimony. 4. Relief Requested Petitioner respectfully requests the following actions be taken: 1. Formally include Kelly Truelove as a relevant party to this case, given her demonstrated impact on Petitioner's financial stability and living situation. 2. Acknowledge and rectify the judicial oversight that has allowed perjury by Jozef Hanratty and misrepresentation by Joshua Garrett to affect prior rulings. 3. Reevaluate all temporary custody orders that were based on false statements and manipulated evidence. 4. Allow Petitioner to submit all relevant financial records and prior communication attempts as evidence of Kelly Truelove’s manipulative tactics in this case.`

    date: "2025-18-2",
    type: "Petition",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a Writ of Mandamus directing the Honorable MATT ALAN SELBY, Circuit Judge of Stone County, Missouri, to:\r\nPerform his mandatory duty to rule on pending motions and address legal errors;\r\nVacate all orders issued under improper jurisdiction;\r\nTransfer this matter to the appropriate Kansas court under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA); and\r\nRestore Petitioner�s parental rights and enforce proper visitation with his son, Felix Salmon.\r\nIn support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis case presents a clear failure by the Stone County Circuit Court to perform its mandatory duties under the law. The presiding judge has:\r\nFailed to rule on multiple motions filed by Petitioner, including motions to dismiss for improper venue and motions to transfer jurisdiction under the UCCJEA; It is well-established that a trial court has a non-discretionary duty to rule on properly filed motions. See State ex rel. Jones v. McGhee, 639 S.W.2d 60 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982) (holding that a judge must rule on pending motions within a reasonable time). Failure to do so constitutes a denial of due process, warranting mandamus relief.\r\nMaintained jurisdiction over this case despite clear evidence that Stone County, Missouri, lacks jurisdiction;\r\nAllowed the Real Party in Interest, Crycella Freitag, to repeatedly violate court-ordered visitation and alienate Petitioner from his son;\r\nAllowed procedural misconduct that has placed Petitioner at a severe disadvantage, effectively denying him due process.\r\nThis Court must intervene to correct these injustices and ensure that legal procedures are followed.\r\nII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\r\nA. Improper Jurisdiction and Venue\r\nFelix Salmon resided in Stone County, Missouri, for less than six months (May 17, 2024 � November 13, 2024). Under RSMo � 452.700 and K.S.A. 23-37,201, jurisdiction vests in the state where the child has resided for six consecutive months immediately preceding the commencement of the action. Felix did not meet this threshold in Stone County. Wyandotte County is the only legitimate claim to jurisdiction, rendering the orders of the Stone County Circuit Court void ab initio.\r\nPursuant to the UCCJEA (RSMo � 452.700 et seq.), jurisdiction is proper only where the child has lived for six consecutive months prior to legal action.\r\nBoth parents currently reside in Kansas, making Kansas the appropriate forum for this case under the UCCJEA.\r\nCrycella Freitag engaged in jurisdictional manipulation by delaying separation and creating a temporary residence in Stone County Missouri to fabricate a legal basis for venue.\r\nB. Judge�s Failure to Address Motions\r\nPetitioner has filed multiple motions, including:\r\nMotion to Dismiss for Improper Venue;\r\nMotion to Transfer Jurisdiction to Kansas;\r\nMotion to Enforce Visitation;\r\nMotion for Protection of Minor Witness from Undue Influence (For my daughter Anya, whom I have raised for seven years and have not seen for three months);\r\nMotion for Emergency Relief (Documented three instances where Crycella has been unsafe with Felix, addressing direct concerns regarding his safety);\r\nMotion for Communication Order (Petitioner had to disclose all information in interrogatories, whereas Crycella was able to withhold critical information, including her financial obligations and residency);\r\nMotion to Sanction Petitioner and Petitioner�s Counsel for Unethical and Obstructive Conduct (Addressing misconduct by Mr. Garrett);\r\nMotion to Issue Subpoena for Minor Witness Testimony (Attempted to obtain testimony from Anya before further manipulation by Crycella);\r\nMotion for Home Inspection and Financial Disclosure (Petitioner has been denied any information regarding Felix's living conditions, has not been allowed to inspect his sleeping arrangements, and has been left without knowledge while Crycella retains access to Petitioner�s home).\r\nThe judge has failed to rule on these motions, leaving Petitioner without recourse and violating his right to due process. The United States Supreme Court has long held that 'The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.' Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). The failure to rule on pending motions deprives Petitioner of this right, necessitating intervention from this Court.\r\nC. Denial of Visitation and Parental Rights\r\nThe judge granted Petitioner only up to two hours of supervised visitation on Saturdays up to Crycella�s discretion.\r\nCrycella Freitag has repeatedly denied visitation in violation of court orders.\r\nFelix is currently living in a household with eight people and 14 animals, raising concerns about his well-being and stability.\r\nCrycella Freitag has refused to allow Petitioner�s family and friends access to Felix, further alienating him from his support network.\r\nD. Intentional Financial Hardship Created by Crycella Freitag\r\nCrycella Freitag has failed to contribute financially to Felix�s care.\r\nShe has engaged in legal maneuvers intended to drain Petitioner�s financial resources, forcing him to proceed pro se.\r\nThe court's failure to address these issues has compounded the prejudice against Petitioner.\r\nIII. LEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nA. Failure to Perform Mandatory Duties\r\nA trial court has a mandatory duty to rule on properly filed motions. The failure to do so deprives Petitioner of his constitutional right to due process.\r\nB. Violation of the UCCJEA\r\nThe UCCJEA (RSMo � 452.700 et seq.) mandates that jurisdiction is proper where the child has lived for six consecutive months. Felix has not met this threshold in Missouri, making the continued assertion of jurisdiction by Stone County a clear legal error.\r\nC. Clear Abuse of Discretion\r\nThe judge's refusal to transfer jurisdiction despite the clear mandates of the UCCJEA constitutes an abuse of discretion.\r\nD. No Adequate Remedy at Law\r\nPetitioner has exhausted all available legal remedies, filing multiple motions that remain unanswered. The lack of court action leaves Petitioner with no adequate legal remedy other than this writ.\r\nIV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nIssue a Writ of Mandamus directing the Honorable MATT ALAN SELBY to:\r\na) Rule on all pending motions within 14 days;\r\nb) Vacate all orders issued in excess of jurisdiction; and\r\nc) Transfer this matter to Kansas in accordance with the UCCJEA.\r\nRestore Petitioner�s parental rights and enforce meaningful visitation with Felix Salmon.\r\nStay enforcement of any orders granting sole custody to Crycella Freitag pending resolution of this writ.\r\nGrant Petitioner�s request for a fee waiver (see below).\r\nCivil Rights Violations under 42 U.S.C. � 1983\r\nJudge Selby's deliberate failure to rule on motions and enforce parental rights\r\nConstitutional violations of due process\r\nDeprivation of parental rights under color of law These violations can yield significant damages, including punitive damages against state actors\r\nTort Claims Against Opposing Party\r\nIntentional infliction of emotional distress\r\nFraudulent misrepresentation to establish jurisdiction\r\nParental alienation \r\nBad faith litigation\r\nAll therapy/counseling costs related to separation from Felix\r\nRealized Damages Documentation (will be provided)\r\nLost wages from improper venue\r\nTravel expenses\r\nLegal costs\r\nLost business opportunities\r\nProperty access denial\r\nHealthcare access denial\r\nInterference with Parent-Child Relationship\r\nEvery denied visitation with monetary value\r\nImpact on Felix's relationship with siblings\r\nLoss of parental companionship\r\nEducational decision-making interference\r\nV. REQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests a fee waiver for the filing of this petition. Petitioner is currently experiencing financial hardship and lacks the resources to pay the filing fee. A fee waiver is necessary to ensure access to justice.\r\nVI. CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court grant the Writ of Mandamus and provide the relief requested.`

    content: `I, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, being duly sworn, state as follows:\r\nIntroduction\r\nI am the Respondent/Counter-Petitioner in the above-captioned matter.\r\nResidency of Felix Salmon\r\nFelix Salmon resided in Stone County, Missouri, for less than six months�from May 17, 2024, to November 13, 2024.\r\nLack of Significant Connection to Stone County\r\nAt the time this case was filed, neither parent had any significant connection to Stone County. Neither I nor Crycella Freitag have any meaningful ties to Stone County. We have no family, no friends, and no community connections in the area. The fact that our witnesses had to drive over four hours to attend court proceedings further demonstrates the lack of any substantial connection to the jurisdiction.\r\nDeceptive Statements by Petitioner\r\nThe only reason Felix remained in Stone County beyond what was necessary was due to deceptive statements made by Petitioner/Counter-Respondent, Crycella Freitag.\r\nExhibit I: Text Messages\r\nAttached as Exhibit I are text messages from Crycella Freitag, in which she:\r\nEncouraged me to remain in Branson, despite having no intention of living with me.\r\nGave false assurances about our cohabitation, despite admitting in court that she had lost romantic interest and moved out permanently.\r\nDeliberately attempted to influence my residency to create a false claim to Stone County as a proper venue.\r\nThese messages demonstrate that Petitioner/Counter-Respondent and her legal counsel manipulated the legal process in bad faith to establish an improper venue.\r\nCurrent Residency and Jurisdiction\r\nBoth parties now reside in Kansas. Missouri no longer has a continuing jurisdictional basis under the UCCJEA. Even if Missouri originally had jurisdiction, Stone County was an improper venue due to fraud and misrepresentation.\r\nUnfair Treatment by the Court\r\nThroughout these proceedings, the court has treated me unfairly in the following ways:\r\nPerjury by Petitioner: The court has ignored clear evidence of perjury by Crycella Freitag, and her witness Jozef Hanratty including her false statements about her intentions to cohabitate, housing instability, and her deliberate misrepresentation of facts to establish jurisdiction in Stone County.\r\nIgnoring Motions: The judge has consistently ignored or denied all motions filed by me, including motions to dismiss for improper venue and motions to transfer jurisdiction to Kansas.\r\nArbitrary Civil Arguments: The judge has allowed arbitrary civil arguments that are irrelevant to the custody determination, including arguments about my residency and financial status, which have no bearing on the best interests of Felix.\r\nBias and Prejudice: The judge has demonstrated bias and prejudice by consistently ruling in favor of the Petitioner without proper consideration of the evidence or the law.\r\nFailure to Address Fraud: The court has failed to address the fraud and misrepresentation committed by the Petitioner, which has resulted in an improper venue and a miscarriage of justice.\r\nDenial of Visitation: The judge�s order granting me only two hours of visitation on Saturdays was already excessively restrictive and not in the best interests of Felix. However, Crycella Freitag has denied even this limited visitation, further alienating me from my child.\r\nIsolation from Family and Friends: Crycella Freitag has also refused to allow my friends and family to see Felix, effectively isolating him from his extended support network. This is not only unfair to me but also detrimental to Felix�s well-being and emotional development.\r\nRequest for Relief\r\nThis Court must vacate all orders and transfer this matter to the appropriate Kansas court.\r\n\r\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\r\n\r\nExhibit I Link: https://tinyurl.com/yt268ns3`

    content: `MOTION TO OBJECT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION BY RESPONDENT'S SELECTED PSYCHOLOGIST AND TO REASSERT OBJECTIONS TO PRIOR UNADDRESSED ISSUES\r\nCOMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to reject the\r\npsychological evaluation to be conducted by Susan K Vandeusen, who has been selected by\r\nRespondent, and to instead appoint a neutral, court-approved evaluator. Additionally, Petitioner\r\nseeks to formally reassert prior objections which have been ignored in these proceedings. In\r\nsupport thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n\r\nI. OBJECTION TO RESPONDENT'S SELECTED\r\nPSYCHOLOGIST\r\n1. The Evaluator Lacks Neutrality and Presents a Conflict of Interest\r\n1. The appointed psychologist, Susan K Vandeusen, was personally selected by\r\nRespondent, rather than being a neutral evaluator appointed by the Court.\r\n2. It is in the best interest of the child, Felix Salmon, that any psychological evaluation be\r\nconducted by a neutral, court-appointed forensic psychologist, rather than a\r\nprofessional with a potential bias toward one parent.\r\n3. Susan K Vandeusen has no verifiable history of conducting forensic custody\r\nevaluations and lacks publicly available records or professional reviews, raising\r\nconcerns about their credibility.\r\n1\r\n\r\n2. The Appointment of a Neutral Evaluator Ensures Fairness\r\n4. Petitioner respectfully requests that, should a psychological evaluation be deemed\r\nnecessary, the Court appoint a licensed, neutral forensic psychologist with a proven\r\nrecord of unbiased custody evaluations.\r\n5. A neutral evaluator ensures fairness and prevents undue influence from either party in the\r\ncustody proceedings.\r\n3. Due Process and Fair Treatment\r\n6. The appointment of a neutral forensic evaluator is consistent with the principles of due\r\nprocess and fairness in family court proceedings.\r\n7. The Court has a duty to ensure that both parties are treated equally in any\r\npsychological evaluations that may impact custody determinations.\r\n\r\nII. REASSERTION OF PRIOR OBJECTIONS\r\n4. Unaddressed Objections Demonstrating Systemic Bias\r\n8. Petitioner has previously filed motions and objections regarding:\r\n? The unilateral acceptance of Respondent�s requests while Petitioner�s filings\r\nare ignored.\r\n? The failure to acknowledge Petitioner�s evidence regarding financial support,\r\nFelix�s residency history, and the Respondent�s lack of financial contribution.\r\n? The denial of Petitioner�s ability to conduct discovery, including the\r\nopportunity to submit interrogatories and obtain key financial and medical\r\nrecords.\r\n? The failure to address the jurisdictional argument that Felix has resided in\r\nWyandotte County for the majority of his life, making this the proper venue.\r\n? The lack of enforcement against Respondent�s repeated refusals to provide\r\nfinancial support, while Petitioner has been solely responsible for childcare and\r\nliving expenses.\r\n5. Pattern of Procedural Imbalance\r\n9. The Court�s pattern of denying or ignoring Petitioner�s motions while granting\r\nRespondent�s requests is creating an unfair procedural imbalance.\r\n10. The failure to consider evidence, grant basic discovery rights, and apply equal\r\nstandards raises serious concerns about judicial impartiality.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\n1. Reject the evaluation by Susan K Vandeusen due to the potential conflict of interest.\r\n2. Appoint a neutral, court-approved forensic psychologist to conduct any required\r\nevaluations.\r\n3. Address and rule on Petitioner�s prior objections, which have been repeatedly\r\nignored.\r\n4. Ensure equal consideration of both parties' filings and motions.\r\n5. Grant any further relief this Court deems just and proper.`

Jozef made false claims about the Plaintiff�s eviction status, which were directly\r\ncontradicted by the lack of proper notice and the Judge�s own acknowledgment.\r\n?

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).  Formal reports detailing these incidents have been filed and are on record with the court. Specifically:\r\nThe presiding judge has made rulings that demonstrate a clear bias against the Counter-Petitioner, ignoring or discounting (17) articles of submitted valid evidence and arguments presented by the Counter-Petitioner.\r\nCourt clerks have engaged in recorded discriminatory behavior as Jurisdictional Overreach & Procedural Violations to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 81.12.\r\nThe Court�s failure to review the evidence allowed perjury to persist on multiple occasions, even after the Counter-Petitioner submitted clear proof to all parties. This disregard for the truth has created a hostile environment and severely prejudiced Counter-Petitioner�s right to a fair hearing.\r\nThese actions violate Due Process Clause outlined in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 3.3 (Candor Toward the Tribunal) and Rule 8.4 (Misconduct) Caperton v.

    status: "Pending",
    content: `Motion for Sanctions Against Mr. Garrett and Crycella Freitag\r\n(Re-filing motion to preserve the issue for appeal) Counter-Petitioner respectfully objects to the Court�s ruling on temporary custody order. Mr. Garrett and Crycella Freitag have repeatedly engaged in bad faith litigation tactics, including perjury, obstruction of justice, and racial bias, despite being warned of the consequences. His actions have caused significant financial, emotional, and psychological harm to Counter-Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and have directly interfered with Micheal�s ability to maintain a relationship with his son, Felix. Specifically:\r\nPerjury and False Testimony: Mr. Garrett called witnesses who knowingly committed perjury, including Crycella, who made false statements under oath (e.g., �Micheal is unstable,� �I�m scared of him,� �Micheal yells at the Judge�). These claims are contradicted by video evidence.\r\nObstruction of Justice: Mr. Garrett coached Crycella in emotional manipulation, as evidenced by his repeated statements such as, �Watch his reaction.� He knowingly allowed this abuse of process to continue for weeks.\r\nUnfair Custody Arrangement: Mr. Garrett requested a biased and unfair custody arrangement that was not in the best interest of Felix and was based on false and inflammatory statements.\r\nWeaponization of the Legal System: Crycella repeatedly made false allegations to law enforcement and the court, including claims that Micheal is �unsafe� or �needs mental help,� without providing any evidence.\r\nRacial Bias: The court's conduct demonstrates a pattern of racial bias, as they consistently undermined the credibility and evidence presented by the Black parent, while giving undue weight to the claims of the white parties involved.\r\nCase Law:\r\nChambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991): Courts have inherent authority to impose sanctions for bad-faith conduct, including abusive litigation tactics.\r\nRoadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752 (1980): Courts can sanction attorneys and parties for misconduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.\r\nShepherd v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 62 F.3d 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1995): Sanctions are appropriate for deliberate deception or obstruction of justice.\r\n\r\nRequested Relief:\r\nLost Work and Time: Award Counter-Petitioner $10,000 for lost work and time directly resulting from the biased and bad-faith litigation tactics employed by the opposing party.\r\nDebt Owed:\r\nOrder the immediate payment of the full $90,000 debt owed to Counter-Petitioner, with complete financial transparency to ensure compliance.\r\nCompensatory Sanctions Against Josh Garrett:\r\nImpose sanctions on Josh Garrett in the amount of $60,000 to compensate Micheal Lawrence Salmon for the following:\r\nFinancial Losses: On January 30th, Micheal explicitly warned Mr. Garrett to cease his misconduct and review the evidence, citing $30,000 in damages at that time. Despite this warning, Mr. Garrett doubled down on his bad faith conduct by knowingly presenting false testimony, including the claim that Kelly Truelove verified Jozef Hanratty�s narrative, which is contradicted by the evidence.\r\nRelationship Damages: Mr. Garrett�s actions have directly interfered with Micheal�s ability to maintain a relationship with his son, Felix, causing irreparable harm and to his family who are following this case.\r\nEmotional Distress: Micheal has endured severe emotional and psychological harm as a result of Mr. Garrett�s misconduct, including the perpetuation of false claims and perjury.\r\nThe Court compels the disclosure of all communications between Mr. Garrett, Crycella Freitag, Amanda Freitag (and husband), Kelly Truelove, Stephanie Reed, Tyler Brown, Micheal�s family, and Jozef Hanratty regarding efforts to misrepresent evidence.\r\nThe Court considers the impact of Mr. Garrett�s fraudulent claims on prior rulings, including the temporary custody order, and takes corrective action to rectify any decisions influenced by falsified evidence and strike all false claims submitted as fact.`

    content: `The presiding judge has ruled against Counter-Petitioner multiple times despite clear evidence of perjury, obstruction, and misconduct by opposing counsel and related parties. A pattern of rulings suggests a lack of impartiality, requiring judicial review to ensure that future decisions are based solely on facts and law. The court has previously ignored or dismissed substantial evidence that directly contradicts claims made by Crycella Freitag and her legal team. The judge has failed to enforce accountability against those who have lied under oath, creating a prejudicial environment against Counter-Petitioner. Furthermore, given the pattern of adverse rulings and the clear appearance of judicial bias, Counter-Petitioner respectfully requests certification under Rule 51 for an immediate interlocutory appeal on the question of judicial bias.

Petitioner further requests an immediate hearing due to the urgent nature of this matter. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION AND EMERGENCY BASIS FOR HEARING\r\nPetitioner is the father of Felix Salmon, and the current custody arrangement, as ordered by this Court, is being weaponized by Respondent to intentionally destroy Petitioner�s relationship with his son.\r\nRespondent has repeatedly and willfully interfered with Petitioner�s court-ordered parenting time and communication with Felix, including but not limited to:\r\na. Hanging up on scheduled calls between Petitioner and Felix;\r\nb. Interrupting conversations, talking over Petitioner, and making false claims about the appropriateness of discussions;\r\nc. Setting financial barriers to prevent Petitioner from exercising his parenting time;\r\nd. Submitting edited video evidence and committing perjury to mislead the Court.\r\nRespondent�s actions are causing immediate and irreparable harm to Felix�s emotional well-being and his relationship with Petitioner. This behavior is intentional, malicious, and in direct violation of this Court�s orders and the best interests of the child.\r\nDespite Petitioner�s repeated attempts to address these issues, the Court has failed to take meaningful action, allowing Respondent to continue her harmful behavior unchecked.\r\nThis matter constitutes an emergency as it involves the immediate welfare of a child and the ongoing violation of Petitioner�s parental rights.\r\n\r\nII.

INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent�s Claims of Fear Are Fabricated and Contradict Her Own Testimony\r\nRespondent has repeatedly claimed she is �scared� of Petitioner to justify withholding the minor child, Felix, from him. However, in court proceedings, Respondent has never testified under oath that she is afraid of Petitioner or that he has done anything to warrant such fear.\r\nThis inconsistency demonstrates that Respondent�s claims are a deliberate fabrication designed to manipulate the Court and alienate Petitioner from his child.\r\nRespondent�s Collusion with Third Parties to Fabricate an Unstable Living Situation\r\nOn December 4, 2024, Respondent conspired with Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove to fabricate an �unstable living situation� for Petitioner.\r\nJozef Hanratty, Petitioner�s former landlord, rescinded his position and directed Petitioner to Kelly Truelove, who then refused all communication.\r\nRespondent facilitated this collusion by refusing to intervene, despite being fully aware of the circumstances.\r\nThis fabricated instability was used to secure a temporary custody order on January 28, 2025, which Respondent now leverages to deny Petitioner access to Felix.\r\nRespondent�s False Accusations and Edited Video Evidence\r\nRespondent originally submitted an edited 12 minute video to the Court, which she admitted was incomplete. The full video, which is over 40 minutes long, was intentionally reduced to then 30 minutes to remove exculpatory evidence and given to Micheal.\r\nIn the video, Petitioner explicitly states, �I see you recording, so let�s get this out of the way so we can have a relationship with our son.� He then lists hypothetical statements a �bad father� might make, which Respondent has since misrepresented as threats.\r\nRespondent�s manipulation of evidence constitutes perjury and a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court.\r\n\r\nII. RESPONDENT�S PATTERN OF MISCONDUCT\r\nRespondent�s Lies Under Oath\r\nRespondent has repeatedly lied under oath, including:\r\nClaiming Petitioner �kicked her out� of the house, despite testifying in court that she left voluntarily each week.\r\nFailing to disclose her collusion with Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove to fabricate Petitioner�s living situation.\r\nMisrepresenting the contents of the video evidence submitted to the Court.\r\nClaiming Petitioner�s housing is unstable, while being the culprit.\r\nRespondent�s Willful Parental Interference\r\nRespondent has consistently interfered with Petitioner�s relationship with Felix by:\r\nDenying Petitioner access to the child without justification.\r\nRefusing to comply with court-ordered visitation schedules.\r\nManipulating the child�s perception of Petitioner through false narratives.\r\nYelling, talking, and demonstrating unstable co-parenting skills in front of Felix during Petitioner's court appointed time forcing narrative.\r\n\r\nIII. REQUEST FOR RELIEF\r\nPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nCompel Respondent to Testify Under Oath\r\nRequire Respondent to testify regarding her claims of fear, her collusion with third parties, and her manipulation of evidence.\r\nHold Respondent in Contempt\r\nFind Respondent in contempt for:\r\nPerjury and willful misrepresentation to the Court.\r\nParental interference and violation of Petitioner�s custodial rights.\r\nManipulation of evidence to mislead the Court.\r\nGrant Remedial Relief\r\nInvalidate the temporary custody order obtained through fraudulent means.\r\nStrike everything Crycella submitted from record.\r\nOrder supervised visitation to restore Petitioner�s relationship with Felix.\r\nRequire Crycella to undergo a psychological evaluation to assess her fitness as a custodial parent.\r\nHave Crycella return all Micheal�s property - (PC)\r\nAward Petitioner attorney�s fees and costs incurred due to Respondent�s misconduct of no less than $60,000 for all the work attributed in the courts bias.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.`

    title: "MOTION TO COMPEL CLERK'S COMPLIANCE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF SCHEDULING MISCONDUCT",
    date: "2025-17-3",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Pro Se, and moves this Court to review and compel the Stone County Circuit Clerk�s office to comply with its obligations under the Local Court Rules and the Missouri Sunshine Law. The Clerk�s refusal to schedule my emergency motion on the designated Motion Day and its misrepresentation of the hearing date constitute misconduct and obstruct my right to due process and timely relief.\r\n\r\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nEmergency Motion Filed on March 13, 2025:\r\nOn March 13, 2025, I filed an Emergency Motion to Enforce and Protect Parental Communication Rights (hereinafter �Emergency Motion�). This motion was filed in good faith to address urgent issues affecting my parental rights and the well-being of my child.\r\nProper Motion Day for Associate Division I:\r\nPursuant to Local Rule 2.3.2, Motion Days for Associate Division I (presided over by the Hon. Matt A. Selby) occur on the second Friday of each month. For March 2025, the designated Motion Day was March 14, 2025.\r\nClerk�s Refusal to Schedule Motion on March 14, 2025:\r\nDespite filing my Emergency Motion one day before the designated Motion Day (March 13, 2025), the Clerk�s office refused to schedule the motion for March 14, 2025. When I called the Clerk�s office on March 14, 2025, I was informed that my motion was not scheduled for that day and was instead set for April 7, 2025.\r\nMisrepresentation of Hearing Date:\r\nThe Clerk�s office provided no explanation for why my Emergency Motion was not scheduled on the proper Motion Day. Instead, they misrepresented the hearing date, claiming it was set for April 7, 2025, which is not a designated Motion Day for Associate Division I.\r\nViolation of Local Rules and Due Process:\r\nThe Clerk�s actions violate Local Rule 2.3.2 and obstruct my right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. By delaying the hearing of my Emergency Motion, the Clerk�s office is causing irreparable harm to my parental rights and my child�s well-being.\r\n\r\nII. LEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nClerk�s Failure to Follow Local Rules:\r\nThe Clerk�s refusal to schedule my Emergency Motion on the designated Motion Day (March 14, 2025) violates Local Rule 2.3.2, which explicitly states that Motion Days for Associate Division I occur on the second Friday of each month.\r\nMisrepresentation of Hearing Date:\r\nThe Clerk�s office misrepresented the hearing date by claiming my motion was set for April 7, 2025, which is not a valid Motion Day for Associate Division I. This creates the appearance of bias and deliberate obstruction.\r\nViolation of Due Process:\r\nThe Clerk�s actions obstruct my right to due process by delaying the hearing of my Emergency Motion. Emergency motions are intended to address urgent matters, and any delay undermines their purpose and causes irreparable harm.\r\nFailure to Provide Public Records:\r\nDespite my formal requests under the Missouri Sunshine Law (RSMo � 610.010, et seq.), the Clerk�s office has refused to provide a list of scheduled motion hearings and other public records. This lack of transparency further obstructs my ability to advocate for my rights.\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, I respectfully request that this Court:\r\nOrder the Clerk�s Office to immediately provide a list of all motion hearings scheduled from March 1, 2025, to April 7, 2025, including the case numbers, parties involved, and hearing types.\r\nCompel the Clerk�s Office to provide a written explanation as to why my Emergency Motion was not scheduled on the designated Motion Day (March 14, 2025) and why it was instead set for April 7, 2025.\r\nReview the Clerk�s scheduling actions for potential misconduct, including violations of Local Court Rules and the Missouri Sunshine Law.\r\nSet my Emergency Motion for the earliest valid Motion Day in accordance with Local Rule 2.3.2.\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.`

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nJudicial Misconduct:\r\nThe Court has consistently ignored or misrepresented my motions, evidence, and arguments, despite my compliance with all procedural rules and deadlines.\r\nThe Court has failed to address the Clerk�s misconduct, including the refusal to schedule my motions on designated Motion Days and the misrepresentation of hearing dates.\r\nClerk�s Misconduct:\r\nThe Clerk�s office has repeatedly obstructed my access to the court by:\r\nRefusing to schedule my Emergency Motion on the proper Motion Day (March 14, 2025).\r\nMisrepresenting the hearing date as April 7, 2025, which is not a valid Motion Day.\r\nFailing to provide public records requested under the Missouri Sunshine Law.\r\nAbusing Pro se Judge communications.\r\nObstructing the appeals process.\r\nOpposing Counsel�s Misconduct:\r\nMr. Josh Garrett, counsel for the opposing party, has engaged in bad-faith tactics, including:\r\nIgnoring my attempts to communicate and resolve issues related to financial barriers to custody.\r\nSubmitting edited video evidence and relying on false testimony to mislead the Court.\r\nFacilitating perjury in the face of evidence, and conspiring to kidnap.\r\nCoaching Crycella on emotional manipulation techniques\r\nSystemic Bias and Unfair Treatment:\r\nThe cumulative effect of these actions demonstrates a pattern of bias and unfair treatment that has deprived me of my right to due process and a fair hearing.\r\nThe Court�s refusal to address these issues has created an appearance of impropriety and undermined public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system.\r\n\r\nII.

(Missouri Sunshine Law) and obstructs my right to access the court.\r\nOpposing Counsel�s Bad-Faith Tactics:\r\nMr. Garrett�s actions, including the submission of edited video evidence and reliance on false testimony, constitute bad-faith litigation tactics that have prejudiced my case and misled the Court.\r\nIrreparable Harm:\r\nThe cumulative effect of these actions has caused irreparable harm to my parental rights and my child�s well-being. Further proceedings in this case would only compound this harm and perpetuate the unfair treatment I have experienced.\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, I respectfully request that this Court:\r\nDismiss all pending matters in this case due to the pervasive judicial and procedural misconduct that has obstructed my right to due process and a fair hearing.\r\nIssue a written order detailing the Court�s findings regarding the misconduct of the Clerk�s office, opposing counsel, and the Court itself.\r\nRefer this matter to the Missouri Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges for further investigation into the judicial misconduct that has occurred in this case.\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.`

In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nThe Layne Project has engaged in communications and financial arrangements directly impacting the outcome of court-ordered visitation.\r\nOn 02/19/2025, Emily of the Layne Project informed Petitioner via text message that if he could not pay for supervised visitation, they would seek payment from Respondent, and if she refused, they would notify the Court. Despite these assurances, the Layne Project has failed to notify the Court while continuing discussions with Respondent.\r\nThe requested subpoena seeks the production of:\r\na. All communications (including but not limited to emails, text messages, letters, and notes) between the Layne Project, Micheal Salmon, Crycella Freitag, Joshua Garrett, Natalie Kluttz, Carolyn Salmon, Chanille Witham, and any court personnel regarding this case.\r\nb.

Any internal policies or procedures related to notifying the Court of payment disputes or non-compliance with financial obligations.\r\nd. All records of communications between the Layne Project and the Court regarding this matter.\r\nAdditionally, Petitioner seeks to depose representatives of the Layne Project regarding their involvement in the facilitation or obstruction of visitation.\r\nThis information is crucial to determining the extent to which the Layne Project has intervened in the visitation process in a manner inconsistent with their stated obligations and the best interests of the minor child.\r\nPetitioner has reason to believe that Respondent and third parties may be using the Layne Project�s inaction to interfere with visitation rights.\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a subpoena compelling the Layne Project to produce the requested documents and to appear for deposition at a date and time to be determined by the Court.\r\nMOTION TO INCLUDE LAYNE PROJECT INTERVENTION IN CASE RECORD\r\nCOMES NOW, the Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to formally recognize the Layne Project's interference in this case and compel appropriate corrective action. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nThe Layne Project was assigned to facilitate supervised visitation and communication between the parties.\r\nPetitioner was informed by Emily, an employee of the Layne Project, via text message that due to financial constraints, the Layne Project would seek payment from the Respondent and, if she refused, they would notify the Court.\r\nPetitioner proactively informed the Layne Project to proceed accordingly and has remained transparent in all communications regarding the matter.\r\nThe owner of the Layne Project, Trina Nudson, who is also an attorney, confirmed this procedural step to Petitioner.\r\nDespite these assurances, the Layne Project has failed to contact the Court as promised and instead has continued to engage with Respondent, who insists on enforcing the payment requirement while knowing Petitioner cannot comply.\r\nThis inaction has directly affected Petitioner's ability to engage in court-ordered visitations, thereby interfering with due process and access to parental rights.\r\nSuch failure to act as stated constitutes a material obstruction of justice, warranting judicial intervention.\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nOrder the Layne Project to submit a written explanation of their actions and why they have not contacted the Court as stated.\r\nInclude the Layne Project�s conduct as a relevant factor in the proceedings.\r\nIssue any further relief deemed necessary and just under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence WebApp: https://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html`

In support of this objection, Respondent states as follows:\r\nAttorney Garrett�s Presence is Necessary � This hearing concerns Petitioner�s Motion for Attorney�s Fees, a matter in which Attorney Garrett has a direct financial interest and a conflict of interest due to his involvement with The Lane Project. His personal presence is necessary to allow the Court to properly evaluate his claims and permit cross-examination regarding his conduct in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney Garrett�s Misconduct and the Need for Accountability � Throughout this litigation, Attorney Garrett has:\r\n\r\n\r\nRepeatedly misrepresented facts before the Court.\r\nIgnored the Court�s direct order to facilitate a resolution where Respondent could have access to his son.\r\nRefused all communication from Respondent, effectively aiding Petitioner in creating a financial and procedural barrier to visitation.\r\nIntentionally prolonged litigation, inflating fees while obstructing due process.\r\nHis in-person testimony is critical to ensuring transparency and preventing any undue influence or misrepresentation through a remote appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney Garrett Must Be Questioned Regarding His Connection to The Lane Project � Respondent has reason to believe that Attorney Garrett has conflicts of interest and external affiliations that compromise his role as an objective legal representative. His in-person testimony is necessary to address these potential conflicts and ensure they are fully examined before the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhone Testimony Would Prejudice Respondent � Given the complexity and the contested nature of this case, allowing Attorney Garrett to appear remotely would:\r\n\r\n\r\nDeny Respondent the ability to challenge his role in obstructing the Court�s orders.\r\nPrevent full examination of his financial interests in prolonging litigation.\r\nAllow Garrett to evade accountability for his misconduct and procedural violations.\r\nAn in-person appearance ensures that Respondent may effectively challenge his assertions and hold him accountable for his conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest for an Earlier Hearing Date � To prevent scheduling conflicts from obstructing this matter, Respondent respectfully requests that the hearing be rescheduled for an earlier date to ensure Attorney Garrett�s physical attendance. Given the Court�s decision to expedite Petitioner�s attorney fee hearing while delaying Respondent�s emergency motions, this request is necessary to ensure fairness in scheduling.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nDeny Attorney Garrett�s request for a telephonic appearance and require his in-person attendance.\r\nCompel Garrett to answer under oath regarding his relationship with The Lane Project and his role in obstructing the Court�s orders.\r\nReschedule the hearing to an earlier date to prevent further procedural gamesmanship.\r\nGrant any other relief this Court deems just and proper.\r\nPetitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.`

    date: "2025-25-3",
    type: "Letter",
    status: "Denied",
    content: `Dear Judge Selby,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Court�s notice of hearing for March 26th, 2025 at 10:30 a.m - \r\nI am writing to formally address the ongoing violations of my rights and the court�s repeated failure to apply legal standards fairly in my custody case. This letter serves as an official request for written clarification on multiple legal errors and procedural violations that have obstructed my ability to seek justice. As established in State ex rel. Houska v. Dickhaner, 323 S.W.3d 29 (Mo. 2010), mandamus is appropriate when a court fails to perform duties required by law or abuses its discretion in ways that cannot be adequately remedied through ordinary appeals. The pattern of procedural violations in this case meets this standard.\r\n1. The Unlawful Basis for the Temporary Custody Order\r\nMissouri law is clear on the requirements for granting a temporary custody order: Imminent Danger Standard (RSMo 210.125): Emergency custody can only be granted if there is reasonable cause to believe a child is in immediate danger due to abuse or neglect. Temporary Custody Orders (RSMo 452.380): Courts must rely on clear, supporting evidence demonstrating that a change in custody is in the child�s best interest.\r\nThe sole justification for granting the temporary custody motion was the false testimony of Jozef Hanratty, who falsely claimed I was facing eviction. The court itself acknowledged that if I remained in my residence the following week, it would prove Jozef�s dishonesty.\r\nOne week later, I was still in my residence, confirming the perjury committed by Hanratty. Despite this, my motion to dismiss was ignored. Furthermore, I have since submitted multiple documents proving Jozef and Crycella�s dishonesty, including:\r\nA letter from Kelly Truelove�s attorney validating my lawful tenancy.\r\nVideo evidence of Crycella denying my court-ordered communication with Felix.\r\nFormal legal documents disproving the eviction claim.\r\nYet, the court has refused to review this clear and irrefutable evidence, allowing an unlawful ruling to stand in direct violation of due process. Mr. Garrett has facilitated this unlawful and in bad faith conspiracy to purge me of my residence.\r\nThe Missouri Supreme Court in In re Marriage of Hendrix, 183 S.W.3d 582 (Mo. 2006), established that modifications to custody must be supported by substantial evidence demonstrating that a change would serve the child's best interests. The court's continued reliance on Mr. Hanratty's demonstrably false testimony violates this standard. Furthermore, in Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d 30 (Mo. 1976), the court established that judicial decisions must be supported by substantial evidence and cannot be against the weight of the evidence. The refusal to consider my documentary proof directly contradicts this foundational principle of Missouri law.\r\n2. Due Process Violations and the Court�s Pattern of Dismissal\r\nFor nearly two months, I have submitted repeated requests for enforcement of court orders, sanctions for perjury, and responses to procedural violations. Instead of legal resolution, I have been met with deliberate inaction, refusal to acknowledge evidence, and arbitrary denials of my motions. The following concerns require immediate explanation:\r\nWhy has the court repeatedly refused to review my submitted evidence?\r\nWhy have I been denied an opportunity to properly present my case, with time limits imposed despite the complexity and volume of the evidence?\r\nWhy has the court failed to enforce its own orders when Crycella continues to violate custody agreements and deny communication?\r\nWhat standard of proof is this court applying, and why is it selectively disregarding evidence that disproves the opposing party�s claims?\r\nThe refusal to provide transparency on these legal issues does not just harm me�it sets a precedent that erodes public trust in the judicial system. The United States Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), recognized that parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children. This court's repeated refusal to review submitted evidence and provide a fair hearing violates this constitutionally protected right. As established in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), procedural due process requires balancing the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation through current procedures, and the government's interest. The current proceedings fail this constitutional test by systematically denying my opportunity to present evidence that directly refutes the claims upon which the temporary order was based.\r\n3. The Court�s Direct Role in Facilitating the Destruction of Parental Rights\r\nThe law recognizes that continued separation from a parent is inherently damaging to a child. If the court is genuinely operating in Felix�s best interest, it must answer the following:\r\nHow does prolonged separation from a fit and loving parent benefit Felix�s well-being?\r\nWhat specific needs was Felix not receiving while in my care?\r\nWhy has the court refused to provide a formal reason for my denied custody and visitation rights?\r\nYour refusal to address these questions has directly enabled the obstruction of my parental rights, and the damage inflicted upon my relationship with Felix may soon become irreparable. In Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972), the Supreme Court held that parents are entitled to a hearing on their fitness before their children can be removed from their custody. This court has effectively bypassed this requirement by maintaining separation without proper evidentiary basis. The Missouri Court of Appeals in Searcy v. Searcy, 38 S.W.3d 462 (Mo. App. 2001), emphasized that the best interest of the child standard requires consideration of the child's need for meaningful contact with both parents. The prolonged and unjustified separation from Felix directly contradicts this established legal principle.\r\n4. Judicial Negligence Has Resulted in a Legal Imbalance\r\nYour Honor, in a courtroom, both parties must be held to the same standard. Yet, Mr. Garrett and Crycella have been permitted to:\r\nCommit perjury without consequence.\r\nIgnore court orders without penalty.\r\nRefuse transparency while I am forced to provide full financial disclosure.\r\nWithhold communications and legal documentation necessary for my case.\r\nMeanwhile, I have faced relentless obstruction in my efforts to simply ensure fairness.\r\n5. The Court�s Failure to Address These Issues Will Be Part of the Official Record\r\nAs established in Nazeri v. Missouri Valley College, 860 S.W.2d 303 (Mo. 1993), courts have an obligation to consider evidence properly submitted. The systematic dismissal of my evidence without explanation violates this fundamental judicial responsibility. For the purposes of creating a clear record for appeal under the standards set forth in Murphy v. Carron, I request specific findings regarding what evidence the court has considered and the legal basis for dismissing verified documentation that directly contradicts opposing counsel's claims.\r\nTo ensure clarity and for the purposes of an appeal, I request that the following be addressed:\r\nWhat specific evidence does this court consider insufficient, and by what legal standard is it being dismissed?\r\nHas the court reviewed the video evidence of Crycella violating my custody rights?\r\nWhat authority does Mr. Garrett have in determining custody arrangements, and why has he been given the authority to refuse communication between me and my son?\r\nWhy has the court failed to enforce its own orders while simultaneously penalizing me for procedural actions that I have lawfully followed?\r\nWhat additional evidence does the court require to correct its clear bias?\r\n6. This Court Must Take Responsibility for the Harm It Has Caused\r\nThe failure to fairly enforce the law has emboldened Crycella to continue violating my rights without fear of consequence. This is not just a failure of one case�it is an institutional failure that undermines the very function of the judicial system. This court�s failure to enforce the law fairly has created an environment where Crycella feels emboldened to violate my rights with impunity, effectively destroying any chance at a meaningful parent-child relationship. Your Honor, awarding fees to Crycella and Mr. Garrett in this case would set a dangerous precedent�one where pro se litigants who uncover procedural errors are penalized financially while attorneys who fail to address these errors get rewarded. The work I have done vastly exceeds Mr. Garrett�s, and it was necessitated by his and the court�s own failures. \r\nI demand a formal, on-the-record response to these issues before my upcoming hearing and request that this letter be entered into the official record of these proceedings.`

The actions of Judge Matt Alan Selby demonstrate a willful and persistent failure to perform duties, a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and conduct that brings the judiciary into disrepute.\r\nCase No. 24SN-DR00104\r\nAllegations of Judicial Misconduct:\r\nWillful Failure to Perform Duties & Due Process Violations\r\nJudge Matt Alan Selby has systematically ignored and refused to rule on numerous motions that were properly filed and served.\r\nThis refusal to address critical legal matters has directly prejudiced my case and deprived me of my constitutional right to a fair hearing.\r\nBias and Unequal Treatment of Litigants\r\nThe judge has demonstrated a pattern of favoring the opposing party, including responding to their informal communications while refusing to address my formal filings.\r\nIn one instance, the judge ignored my submitted physical evidence, refused to accept it, then ruled in the opposing counsel's favor because he had to pick his kids up from school.\r\nFailure to Adhere to Court Procedures & Judicial Ethics\r\nThe judge has acted in contravention of judicial standards by failing to issue written orders on key matters, making it impossible to properly appeal rulings.\r\nThe judge has permitted opposing counsel to violate procedural rules without consequence while holding me, as a pro se litigant, to a different standard.\r\nConduct Bringing the Judiciary into Disrepute\r\nThe judge�s refusal to rule on properly submitted filings, coupled with apparent bias, has created the appearance of impropriety and diminished public confidence in the court�s ability to function impartially.\r\nRequested Action:\r\nGiven the severity of these violations, I respectfully request the Commission conduct a full investigation intoJudge Matt Alan Selby�s misconduct. I urge the Commission to consider formal disciplinary action, including reprimand, suspension, or referral to the Missouri Supreme Court for removal, if appropriate.\r\nI have attached supporting documents, including copies of my motions, court transcripts, and any relevant communications, to substantiate my claims. I am available to provide further information or testimony as needed.\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.`

    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Movant, and respectfully moves this Court to address multiple procedural and substantive violations occurring during the 3/27/2025 Webex hearing, including judicial misconduct, denial of due process, and failure to enforce visitation rights. In support thereof, Movant states as follows:\r\n1. Judicial Misconduct and Bias\r\nThe Court repeatedly misrepresented Movant�s statements on record, requiring Movant to repeat himself multiple times while the judge feigned confusion.\r\nThe Court�s behavior resulted in material distortion of the record, which may severely impact appellate review and deprives Movant of a fair hearing.\r\nThe Court manipulated the proceedings to align with a predetermined outcome, ignoring relevant facts and legal arguments presented by Movant.\r\nThe court refused three occasions of preliminary questions that would assist Movant.\r\n2. Denial of Due Process\r\nThe Webex hearing was improperly terminated, preventing Movant from asking critical questions and further clarifying mischaracterized statements.\r\nThe Court disregarded prior motions and filings, forcing Movant to resubmit information that had already been placed on record, thereby delaying resolution and causing undue burden.\r\nThe Court allowed opposing counsel, Josh Garrett, to unilaterally dictate supervision terms without review or proper legal authority.\r\n3. Failure to Enforce Custody and Visitation Rights\r\nMovant has been wrongfully denied visitation with his child, Felix, for over two months, in direct violation of prior orders and Missouri custody laws.\r\nThe Court failed to take action despite acknowledging that Respondent, Crycella Freitag, was in violation of previous orders.\r\nThe Court�s inaction effectively condones Respondent�s noncompliance, further alienating Movant from his child and undermining the best interests of the minor.\r\n4. Misconduct by Opposing Counsel\r\nOpposing counsel, Josh Garrett, falsely framed a prior phone call to paint Movant in a negative light, attempting to distort the record.\r\nThe Court, while acknowledging a \"grey area,\" nonetheless failed to hold Respondent accountable for her refusal to comply with court-ordered visitation.\r\nOpposing counsel has continuously acted in bad faith by obstructing Movant�s parental rights, yet the Court continues to allow his undue influence over supervision arrangements.\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nCorrect the official court record to reflect Movant�s actual statements, as opposed to the judge�s mischaracterizations.\r\nProvide Movant with an opportunity to clarify any outstanding issues unfairly cut off during the Webex hearing.\r\nImmediately enforce prior visitation orders and sanction Respondent for willful noncompliance.\r\nRemove opposing counsel�s undue influence over supervision arrangements and assign an impartial third party.\r\nIssue any further relief deemed just and proper in the interest of fairness and due process.\r\nPETITIONER�S MOTION FOR HEARING AND REVIEW\r\nCOMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court set a hearing and conduct a review on March 31, 2025, to address the numerous accusations and questions that the Court has refused to acknowledge throughout these proceedings. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\r\nPetitioner has submitted multiple motions highlighting critical procedural failures, judicial bias concerns, and violations of due process that have yet to be properly acknowledged or adjudicated.\r\nThe Court has failed to respond to or act upon key motions and court orders, creating an unfair and prejudicial environment against Petitioner.\r\nThe Court has provided responses to the opposing counsel�s submissions while refusing to address direct communications and concerns raised by Petitioner, further demonstrating bias and procedural misconduct.\r\nPetitioner asserts that the failure to address these issues has resulted in continued harm and an obstruction of justice, warranting immediate review and resolution.\r\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nA. Schedule a hearing on March 31, 2025, to review all unacknowledged accusations and procedural concerns raised by Petitioner; B. Address and provide rulings on all outstanding motions previously submitted by Petitioner; C. Ensure a fair and unbiased review of all concerns that have been improperly dismissed or ignored; D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.`

    content: `NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to:\r\nCompel Counter-Respondent Freitag to immediately schedule and pay for Movant�s psychological evaluation as ordered by this Court on February 25, 2025.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrike the fraudulent statement in the March 26 Notice of Entry, which incorrectly claims that Movant was ordered to \"file\" a psychological evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSanction Counter-Respondent Freitag and Attorney Garrett for their noncompliance with the Court�s February 25 order and their misrepresentation to the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUNDS FOR RELIEF\r\nThe February 25, 2025 Order Clearly Required Counter-Respondent Freitag to Arrange and Pay for the Psychological Evaluation.\r\n\r\n The Court�s original order (Exhibit A) specifically states:\r\n \"Counter-Respondent (Freitag) shall arrange and pay for Movant�s psychological evaluation.\"\r\n Despite this explicit directive, Counter-Respondent Freitag has failed to comply for over 30 days. Nevertheless, the March 26 Notice of Entry falsely states that Movant was ordered to obtain the evaluation, thus inaccurately portraying Movant as noncompliant.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial Fraud on the Record.\r\n\r\n The March 26 Notice claims:\r\n \"Movant was ordered to obtain a psychological examination on February 25, 2025.\"\r\n This statement is demonstrably false. As the attached order (Exhibit A) clearly indicates, the responsibility to arrange and pay for the evaluation was placed on Counter-Respondent Freitag, not Movant. This misrepresentation has prejudiced Movant by casting a false light on his compliance with court orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelegation of Judicial Responsibilities to Opposing Counsel.\r\n\r\n In a recent phone call with the Clerk�s Office (Exhibit C), the Clerk confirmed:\r\n \"The judge said you need to contact Mr. Garrett for next steps.\"\r\n This is a violation of Missouri Code of Judicial Conduct 2.2, which prohibits judges from delegating their judicial responsibilities to opposing counsel. Mr. Garrett has no legal authority to dictate the Court�s orders. This conduct undermines the integrity of these proceedings and violates Movant�s rights to a fair and impartial process.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nMovant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nOrder Counter-Respondent Freitag to schedule and pay for the psychological evaluation within 48 hours of this motion�s filing or hold Counter-Respondent Freitag in contempt of court for failing to comply with the February 25, 2025 order.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrike the false statement in the March 26 Notice of Entry which claims that Movant was ordered to obtain the psychological evaluation, correcting the record to reflect the true terms of the February 25 order.\r\n\r\n\r\nSanction Counter-Respondent Freitag and Attorney Garrett for their continued noncompliance and misrepresentation of the Court�s orders, as outlined above.\r\n\r\n\r\nClarify that the judge�not opposing counsel�must rule on motions and make determinations regarding procedural matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOF OF FRAUD (FILED EXHIBITS)\r\nExhibit A: February 25, 2025 Order, showing Counter-Respondent Freitag�s obligation to arrange and pay for the evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExhibit B: March 26, 2025 Notice of Entry, highlighting the fraudulent statement regarding the responsibility for the psychological evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExhibit C: Call log/recording from Clerk�s Office, confirming the judge�s improper delegation of responsibilities to opposing counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL WARNING TO THE COURT\r\nAs the Missouri Court of Appeals is currently reviewing this case:\r\nCourt of Appeals Case No. SD38905\r\nMovant formally requests the Court take immediate action to correct these issues. If the Court fails to address these concerns promptly:\r\nMovant will file a judicial misconduct complaint against the judge and counsel involved in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovant will seek federal intervention under 42 U.S.C. � 1983 for violations of constitutional rights, including due process and equal protection.`

    content: `NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court for an immediate ruling on all pending motions, an award of sole legal and physical custody, child support, and legal fees, based on the following:\r\nI. MOTION FOR PROMPT RULING ON PENDING MOTIONS\r\nMovant has filed multiple motions essential to the fair adjudication of this case, yet they remain unresolved despite proper service and presentation to the Court.\r\nThe lack of rulings has caused significant prejudice to Movant, including but not limited to:\r\nHindrance of Movant�s ability to exercise court-ordered parenting time.\r\nProcedural confusion due to the Court�s failure to enforce compliance.\r\nLack of legal clarity, creating an unfair advantage for Respondent.\r\nFailure to rule on these motions constitutes judicial inaction, violating Movant�s due process rights and judicial efficiency principles.\r\nMovant requests an immediate ruling on all pending motions, including a written explanation for any motion the Court declines to rule on.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nIssue rulings on all outstanding motions without further delay;\r\nProvide a written explanation for any motion the Court declines to rule on; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\nII. MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE AWARD OF MAKEUP PARENTING TIME DUE TO COURT-CAUSED PREJUDICE\r\nOn 03/26/2025, this Court issued a correction acknowledging prior procedural errors that contributed to delays in Movant�s parenting time.\r\nThese delays were not caused by Movant but rather by court-recognized procedural failures and Respondent�s noncompliance.\r\nAs a direct result, Movant has suffered a significant and unjust loss of time with his child, which has harmed the parent-child relationship.\r\nThe Court has both the authority and the obligation to rectify this harm by awarding immediate and uninterrupted makeup parenting time.\r\nMovant requests that the full amount of lost time be restored in an expedited manner.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nOrder immediate makeup parenting time for the full amount of time lost due to court delays;\r\nSet an expedited schedule for the makeup time; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and necessary.\r\nIII. MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST RESPONDENT FOR MISREPRESENTATION AND NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS\r\nThe Court�s recent correction confirms that Respondent engaged in misrepresentation regarding the execution of prior orders.\r\nRespondent�s deliberate mischaracterization of the Court�s directive resulted in an unjustified loss of Movant�s parenting time.\r\nThe Court has the inherent authority to sanction parties who act in bad faith and obstruct justice.\r\nMovant requests that this Court impose appropriate sanctions, including but not limited to:\r\nMonetary sanctions for attorney�s fees and costs incurred due to Respondent�s misrepresentation.\r\nCompensatory sanctions in the form of additional parenting time beyond standard makeup time.\r\nJudicial warnings or contempt findings to deter further misconduct.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nIssue sanctions against Respondent for bad faith conduct;\r\nAward compensatory relief in the form of additional parenting time; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\r\nIV. MOTION FOR SOLE CUSTODY, CHILD SUPPORT, AND LEGAL FEES\r\nGiven the documented history of Respondent�s noncompliance, obstruction, and misrepresentation, it is in the best interest of the minor child that Movant be awarded sole legal and physical custody.\r\nRespondent has demonstrated a pattern of behavior that prioritizes obstruction over the well-being of the child, necessitating a change in custody.\r\nMovant has provided a stable and supportive environment, and granting sole custody will ensure the child�s best interests are met.\r\nMovant requests that Respondent be ordered to pay child support in accordance with statutory guidelines, retroactive to the date of initial filing.\r\nGiven Respondent�s bad faith conduct, Movant also seeks an award of legal fees incurred due to unnecessary litigation caused by Respondent�s actions.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nAward Movant sole legal and physical custody of the minor child;\r\nOrder Respondent to pay child support, retroactive to 1 year;\r\nAward Movant all previous motions in full;\r\nOrder Respondent to pay Movant�s legal fees; and\r\nGrant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.`

In support of this motion, Movant states as follows:\r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe basis for Counter-Respondent�s claims against Movant has been the false assertion that Movant�s living situation was unstable, a claim purportedly supported by an eviction proceeding initiated by Kelly Truelove.\r\nOn 03/21/2025, the eviction case filed by Kelly Truelove was officially dismissed.\r\nThis dismissal, occurring without an adjudication on the merits, demonstrates that the eviction claim itself was either legally unfounded or strategically abandoned, undermining any assertion that Movant�s residence was unstable or unsuitable for parenting time.\r\nEVIDENCE OF COLLUSION AND BAD FAITH\r\nCounter-Respondent, through her attorney Josh Garrett, has relied on the purported eviction to bolster her case against Movant, despite lacking any valid legal foundation.\r\nAttorney Josh Garrett has admitted to direct communication with Kelly Truelove regarding Movant�s residence, indicating a coordinated effort to fabricate instability in order to justify denying Movant custody rights.\r\nThe involvement of multiple parties in propagating this false narrative constitutes a deliberate conspiracy to prejudice Movant�s case through fraudulent claims and misuse of legal procedures.\r\nThis Court has a duty to recognize and act upon evidence of bad faith litigation tactics, particularly where such actions have materially impacted Movant�s parental rights and due process protections.\r\nLEGAL ARGUMENT\r\nThe submission of evidence demonstrating fraud upon the court and coordinated deception is both relevant and necessary for the just resolution of this case.\r\nCourts have an inherent authority to sanction parties who engage in bad faith litigation and to ensure that judgments are rendered based on factual and legal integrity rather than manufactured falsehoods.\r\nThe dismissal of the eviction action negates the sole argument advanced by Counter-Respondent regarding Movant�s alleged instability and further justifies the granting of full custody to Movant.\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nAccept the official dismissal of the eviction case as submitted evidence in the appeal and present case;\r\nRecognize the coordinated effort to misrepresent Movant�s living situation and consider such actions in the Court�s final determinations;\r\nIssue any necessary sanctions or corrective actions to address the bad faith conduct of Counter-Respondent and her counsel;\r\nGrant any other relief this Court deems just and proper.`

This motion remains ignored, despite its clear relevance in establishing collusion and perjury within these proceedings.\r\nJudicial Obstruction and Procedural Violations\r\nThe Court has consistently ignored my motions while granting those of the opposing party, allowing unchecked perjury, and failing to rule on critical evidence that would dismantle the basis for the custody determination.\r\nThe custody order itself is founded on documented collusion, conspiracy, and perjury�facts which this Court has been presented with repeatedly but refuses to address.\r\nAdditionally, the Court�s persistent refusal to allow me to properly present my case, prepare my arguments, and engage in meaningful hearings constitutes a severe violation of due process.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY MOTION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF PARENTING TIME, CONTEMPT, AND IMMEDIATE RELIEF\r\n1. Background\r\n1.1. This Court previously entered an order granting Movant specific parenting time, including scheduled in-person visits and video calls at designated times and locations.\r\n1.2. Despite these explicit orders, Respondent has repeatedly and willfully violated the Court�s directive by denying Movant his rightful parenting time.\r\n1.3. Most recently, Respondent again denied Movant his court-ordered parenting time this weekend, despite clear instructions from this Court.\r\n2. Ongoing Emotional and Psychological Abuse of the Minor Child\r\n2.1. During a recent video call, the minor child, Felix, exhibited extreme emotional distress, crying uncontrollably for the entire duration of the call.\r\n2.2. Respondent has systematically taught the minor child to hang up on Movant over the past months, thereby actively facilitating alienation and destruction of the parent-child bond.\r\n2.3. When the child was no longer able to disconnect the call, he became severely distressed, at which point Respondent physically struck the child multiple times in an attempt to force compliance.\r\n2.4. Rather than comforting the child, Respondent escalated the situation, verbally reinforcing his distress and punishing him for expressing emotions.\r\n2.5. This behavior demonstrates a deliberate effort to emotionally manipulate and alienate the minor child, causing severe psychological harm.\r\n3. Contempt of Court and Request for Immediate Enforcement\r\n3.1. Respondent�s repeated and blatant disregard for this Court�s orders constitutes willful contempt and justifies immediate court intervention.\r\n3.2. The alienation, physical discipline, and emotional manipulation of the minor child must cease immediately, as these actions are abusive and cause irreparable harm to his well-being.\r\n4. Emergency Relief Requested\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Court to:\r\nFind Respondent in contempt of court for her repeated violations of court orders regarding parenting time and video calls;\r\nGrant an immediate hearing to address these violations and impose appropriate sanctions on Respondent;\r\nOrder make-up parenting time for all missed sessions and ensure strict enforcement moving forward;\r\nSuspend all video calls until such time that Respondent demonstrates a good faith effort to facilitate them without interference or emotional manipulation of the minor child;\r\nModify the current order to provide for immediate enforcement mechanisms to prevent further interference with parenting time, including law enforcement involvement if necessary;\r\nIssue any other relief this Court deems just and necessary in the best interest of the minor child.\r\nWherefore, Respondent requests the Court immediately reinstate my custody and grant any further relief deemed just and proper.`

This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Prohibition under Article V, Section 4 of the Missouri Constitution and Missouri Rule 84.22 et seq., which allows for prohibition to prevent a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or engaging in conduct that denies fundamental fairness.\r\n1.2. A Writ of Prohibition is appropriate where a judge has exhibited bias, refused to rule on critical motions, obstructed justice, or failed to uphold legal procedures in a manner that irreparably harms the litigant�s rights.\r\n1.3.

    content: `I am addressing the ongoing failure of this Court to enforce its own order regarding my psychological evaluation and the selective application of requirements that continue to benefit the Respondent.\r\nI, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, was ordered to complete a psychological evaluation. When I was directed toward a racially biased white psychologist, I motioned for an alternative and provided two Black psychologists. The Court granted my motion, yet Respondent has failed to schedule the required evaluation. Despite this, I complied to the best of my ability by undergoing evaluations through two AI psychologists. The Court has failed to enforce its own ruling while allowing Respondent to evade compliance entirely.\r\nAdditionally, I requested a psychological evaluation for Respondent to ensure fairness, yet the Court has ignored this motion, continuing the pattern of bias. If the Court will not enforce this order against Respondent, she should be barred from making psychological claims or defenses at trial.\r\nInstead of ruling on my motion to enforce compliance, the Court has chosen to delay all decisions by scheduling a last-minute hearing on April 4, 2025, lumping together all pending motions. However, this hearing has now been abruptly canceled without reason, further delaying justice and denying me my right to have these urgent matters addressed. The Court�s refusal to issue rulings while obstructing my ability to be heard is a clear procedural failure that only benefits Respondent at my expense.\r\nRather than addressing these issues, the Court appears focused on venue changes rather than issuing rulings. I request an immediate ruling enforcing Respondent�s compliance with the psychological evaluation order and sanctions for her failure to act. If the Court fails to enforce its order, Respondent must be barred from introducing psychological arguments in trial. The Court�s continued delay, along with the unjustified cancellation of scheduled proceedings, only compounds the procedural failures that have already prejudiced my case.\r\nJUDICIAL NOTICE OF COURT FAILURE TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION ORDER\r\nCOMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this Judicial Notice regarding the Court�s failure to enforce its own orders pertaining to psychological evaluations, stating as follows:\r\nPursuant to prior court orders, both parties were required to complete psychological evaluations.\r\nMovant has fully complied, completing and submitting two AI-based psychological evaluations in February 2025.\r\nRespondent was directed to schedule a psychological evaluation and was provided two Black psychologists for scheduling on March 18 2025 prior to this filing.\r\n\r\nVerified Qualified Evaluators � Respondent now submits two verified professionals with the credentials and experience necessary for psychological evaluations relevant to this case:\r\n\r\n\r\nCaleb M. Stephens, LMSW, LCSW � A licensed therapist based in Kansas City with extensive experience in trauma, family therapy, and psychological evaluations. Website: https://drcalebstephens.com.\r\nLiz Davis, LPC � A licensed professional counselor in Kansas City with expertise in psychological assessments and therapy. Website: https://www.lizdavistherapy.com.\r\n\r\nRespondent has failed to take any steps to complete the court-ordered evaluation, refusing to schedule with the provided professionals.\r\nMovant filed a Motion to Enforce Compliance with the psychological evaluation order, which has been ignored by the Court, despite Respondent�s continued noncompliance.\r\nThe Court�s failure to enforce its order enables Respondent�s continued refusal to comply, creating an unfair and prejudicial imbalance in these proceedings.\r\nThe Court�s selective enforcement of its own directives demonstrates judicial bias and improper favor toward Respondent.\r\nMovant requests an immediate ruling requiring Respondent�s compliance before trial or, in the alternative, barring Respondent from introducing any psychological arguments due to her failure to comply with the Court�s order.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:\r\nA. Issue an immediate ruling compelling Respondent�s compliance with the psychological evaluation order, with sanctions for continued refusal; or\r\nB. Prohibit Respondent from presenting any psychological-based claims or defenses in trial due to her failure to comply; andC. Grant any further relief this Court deems just and proper.`

No prior notice or explanation regarding the cancellation was provided to the Movant, and this cancellation significantly disrupts the progress of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for Objection: The Movant respectfully objects to the cancellation of the hearing, as it violates the Movant�s right to a timely hearing under applicable law. Additionally, the cancellation of the hearing without adequate justification undermines the Movant�s ability to pursue relief and obtain a fair resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact of Cancellation: The cancellation of this hearing causes substantial prejudice to the Movant by delaying critical proceedings, including seeing Felix. The Movant has prepared for this hearing, including arranging necessary evidence, witnesses, and legal arguments, and as such, the cancellation imposes undue hardship and further delays the timely resolution of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest for Rescheduled Hearing: The Movant respectfully requests that this Court promptly reschedule the hearing at the earliest available date and allow the case to proceed without further undue delay. The Movant further requests that the Court consider the legal rights and interests at stake in this case, as well as the previous preparation and efforts made by the Movant to comply with the Court�s schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\na.

I am formally demanding that you immediately forward the following legal matters to the District Attorney for prosecution, as is your duty under Kansas law:\r\nPerjury by Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove, who knowingly provided false testimony regarding my residence, fabricating instability to justify depriving me of my parental rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nFraudulent Legal Conduct by Josh Garrett, who orchestrated the perjury, manipulated evidence, and intentionally suppressed exculpatory facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllegal Temporary Custody Motion by Crycella Freitag, which was submitted without legal standing and in direct violation of jurisdictional law.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial Misconduct, including the deliberate falsification of docket entries, acceptance of known perjury, and the court�s complicity in racial discrimination against me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTampering with Evidence, as an altered video was knowingly entered into the record to misrepresent my character and manipulate the court�s perception.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a matter of discretion�it is a legal obligation.

In support of this Motion, Movant states as follows:\r\nI. STRIKING OF EDITED VIDEO SUBMISSION\r\nThe court has allowed the admission of an edited and misleading video into the record, clearly intended to distort the facts and prejudice the proceedings against Movant.\r\nThis video does not meet the evidentiary standards for authentication, completeness, or fairness as required under Missouri Rules of Evidence.\r\nMovant demands that this tainted evidence be stricken from the record immediately, and that any decisions or considerations made based on its content be vacated as a violation of due process.\r\nII. REMOVAL AND NOTATION OF PREJUDICIAL DOCKET ENTRIES\r\nThe docket entries contain statements that falsely frame Movant in a negative light, demonstrating clear and intentional bias by the Court.\r\nThese docket entries do not reflect actual proceedings or facts but instead serve as a tool to manufacture an unjustified narrative against Movant.\r\nMovant demands that all prejudicial docket entries be struck and that an official notation be entered correcting these misrepresentations.\r\nIII. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PERJURY IN COURT FILINGS\r\nRespondent and her witnesses, including but not limited to Jozef Hanratty and Josh Garrett, have engaged in perjury, presenting knowingly false statements to the Court.\r\nSpecific instances of perjury include, but are not limited to:\r\nFalse testimony regarding Movant�s living situation.\r\nFraudulent claims about financial hardship to deny Movant access to his child.\r\nCollusion with third parties to present fabricated narratives contradicting verified facts.\r\nMovant demands that the Court immediately address these acts of perjury and refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for criminal investigation.\r\nIV. UNLAWFUL TEMPORARY CUSTODY ORDER MUST BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY\r\nThe Court has allowed the enforcement of a temporary custody order that is in clear violation of Missouri law, as it was issued based on procedurally defective motions that lacked legal standing and factual merit.\r\nThis order was obtained through fraudulent representations and should be voided immediately, with full custody reconsidered in favor of Movant based on the egregious conduct of the Respondent.\r\nFurthermore, Movant demands that the Court justify why it has repeatedly ignored clear violations of law and due process, which has directly harmed both Movant and the minor child.\r\nV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Honorable Court:\r\nStrike the altered video from the record and prohibit its use in any further proceedings.\r\nRemove and formally correct prejudicial docket entries that misrepresent the facts.\r\nAcknowledge perjury committed by Respondent and her witnesses and refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.\r\nImmediately vacate the unlawful temporary custody order and reconsider custody arrangements based on verified evidence.\r\nGrant any other relief this Court deems necessary and just to rectify these severe violations of due process and judicial integrity.`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `MOTION TO ADDRESS MANIPULATION AND NONCOMPLIANCE REGARDING COURT-ORDERED PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION\r\nCOMES NOW, Movant, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and moves this Court to acknowledge the Respondent�s and their counsel�s deliberate failure to comply with Court-ordered psychological evaluations, as well as the ongoing judicial bias and manipulation of this requirement to paint Movant in a false and negative light. In support thereof, Movant states as follows:\r\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn 12/13/2024, the Court granted a temporary custody order to Respondent based on the false premise that Movant had unstable living conditions. This was based on perjured testimony from Jozef Hanratty.\r\nThe Court explicitly stated that if Movant remained in his home beyond a week, it would prove Hanratty�s testimony was false.\r\nTwo weeks later, Movant was still in his home. The Court, instead of acknowledging this, asked Josh Garrett to confirm the claim, who falsely stated, \"Kelly Truelove wants him out!\"\r\nTwo months later, Kelly Truelove filed a fraudulent eviction lawsuit, which was immediately dismissed, confirming collusion between Respondent, her counsel, and their witnesses.\r\nOn 01/29/2025, Judge Selby continued to dismiss Movant�s evidence submissions while enabling perjury and parental alienation.\r\nInstead of correcting this injustice, Judge Selby further prejudiced Movant by ordering a psychological evaluation while ignoring Movant�s December 16, 2024 request for Respondent to undergo the same evaluation.\r\nMovant initially objected to the examiners provided by the Court due to their lack of experience with diverse families. On 02/26/2025, Movant filed a Motion to Object to Psychological Examiners.\r\nOn 03/11/2025, Judge Selby granted Movant�s motion to use alternative evaluators, and Movant promptly provided Respondent and her counsel with a list of two qualified Black psychologists.\r\nDespite agreeing to set up the evaluation, opposing counsel engaged in a pattern of obstruction, refusing to schedule the evaluation while engaging in tactics designed to entrap Movant into admitting noncompliance.\r\nMovant engaged in 36 documented email exchanges with opposing counsel, where Movant repeatedly clarified that they needed to schedule the court-ordered evaluation. Respondent and her counsel refused to do so while making sarcastic remarks and further manipulating the process.\r\nThe only evaluators suggested by opposing counsel were white psychologists, despite Movant clearly indicating their preference for an examiner with experience in diverse family dynamics.\r\nThe Court�s ongoing refusal to acknowledge this pattern of obstruction while allowing Respondent to feign compliance demonstrates judicial bias.\r\nII. ARGUMENT\r\nRespondent�s Failure to Comply: The Court ordered both parties to undergo psychological evaluations. Movant provided evaluators, yet Respondent has taken no action to comply.\r\nOpposing Counsel�s Bad Faith Tactics: Instead of complying, opposing counsel engaged in deceptive tactics to manipulate the narrative and paint Movant as noncompliant.\r\nJudicial Bias & Procedural Misconduct: The Court has ignored Movant�s motions and evidence submissions while continuously enabling Respondent�s noncompliance.\r\nDue Process Violation: The Court has denied Movant due process by selectively enforcing orders to Movant�s detriment.\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Court to:\r\nA. Issue an immediate ruling compelling Respondent to comply with the psychological evaluation order and schedule an appointment with one of the approved evaluators within seven (7) days. B. Sanction Respondent and her counsel for bad faith conduct and their deliberate attempts to obstruct compliance. C. Bar Respondent from introducing any psychological-based arguments or defenses at trial due to her failure to comply with the Court order. D. Acknowledge and correct the judicial bias demonstrated in the handling of this issue, ensuring future impartial enforcement of all court orders. E. Grant any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.`

    content: `COMES NOW, Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to strike any outstanding order or implication requiring participation in a psychological evaluation conducted by Midtown Psychological Services, and in support thereof, states the following:\r\n\r\n1. Procedural Background\r\nOn or about February 26, 2025, Movant was contacted by Midtown Psychological Services, stating they had been contacted by Sarah, an associate of the Garrett Law Firm, and had been assigned to conduct a psychological evaluation of Movant allegedly pursuant to a court order.\r\nThe provider confirmed the initial communication came solely from Respondent’s legal counsel, with no record of direct court appointment or oversight. Further, Respondent Crycella Freitag personally paid for the evaluation, a clear breach of neutrality and procedural integrity.\r\nMovant immediately requested written clarification regarding the referral process, scope of evaluation, and the provider’s neutrality.

During this call, a representative from their office stated that Midtown Psychological has formally declined to be involved in this case and has requested that the Garrett Law Firm not contact their office again.\r\nThe provider’s withdrawal confirms that the original evaluation order was not arranged through a neutral process, but instead unilaterally initiated and funded by Respondent and her legal team.\r\n\r\n3. Request for Court Relief\r\nMovant is not opposed to participating in a psychological evaluation so long as it is:\r\nCourt-appointed through a neutral selection process, and\r\nConducted by an evaluator with no prior affiliation with either party.\r\nIn light of these developments, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:\r\nStrike any evaluation order referencing Midtown Psychological or resulting from unilateral appointment by Respondent’s counsel.\r\nIssue a new order appointing a neutral, court-selected evaluator, with costs split equitably or determined by the Court.\r\n\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the relief requested above, strike the existing referral to Midtown Psychological Services, and appoint a neutral psychological evaluator in accordance with fair and impartial procedures.`

    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to vacate its order requiring evaluation by Midtown Psychological Services (\"Midtown\") for the following reasons:\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\nThe Court’s order conditioned any custody modification on Movant completing an evaluation with Midtown—a provider now unavailable due to their refusal to work with Respondent’s counsel (Garrett Law Firm) for ethical reasons.\r\nMidtown’s rejection of Garrett Law Firm confirms:\r\nThe evaluation process was tainted by Respondent’s counsel’s misconduct.\r\nThe Court’s order is now impossible to comply with, as Midtown will not proceed.\r\nThe Court’s linkage of custody to this evaluation punishes Movant for Respondent’s counsel’s actions and violates due process.\r\n\r\nII. LEGAL GROUNDS\r\nA. The Evaluation Order is Void Due to Impossibility\r\nMO Rule 68.01: Court-ordered evaluations must be neutral. Midtown’s withdrawal proves the process was compromised.\r\nMO Supreme Court Precedent: Orders requiring impossible acts (e.g., evaluations with conflicted providers) are unenforceable (State ex rel. M.D.K., 445 S.W.3d 543 (Mo. App. 2014)).\r\n\r\nB. The Garrett Law Firm’s Misconduct Invalided the Process\r\nMidtown’s refusal to work with Garrett Law Firm after payment from Respondent confirms:\r\nEx parte coordination between Respondent’s counsel and the evaluator.\r\nFinancial bias (Respondent pre-paid Midtown before the order issued).\r\n\r\nC. The Court’s Custody Condition is Retaliatory\r\nThe Court’s sole reason for denying modification was Movant’s non-compliance with Midtown’s evaluation—an evaluation now proven unethical.\r\nConditioning custody on a tainted evaluation violates fundamental fairness (In re Marriage of Denton, 169 S.W.3d 604 (Mo. App. 2005)).\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nMovant respectfully requests:\r\nAn order vacating the requirement to undergo evaluation with Midtown Psychological Services.\r\nA finding that Respondent’s counsel’s actions rendered the evaluation process void ab initio.\r\nPermission to seek an independent evaluator from a court-approved panel, with costs borne by Respondent due to her counsel’s misconduct.\r\nAn immediate hearing on custody modification, as the Court’s prior condition is now moot.\r\nIV. CONCLUSION\r\nThe Court cannot enforce an order premised on an unethical, impossible act. Movant seeks justice untainted by Garrett Law Firm’s bad-faith tactics.`

This makes compliance with the Court's directive factually and legally impossible.\r\n\r\nDespite multiple filings and full documentation disproving every harmful allegation made against the Movant, the Court has failed to rule on any of Movant’s motions, and have not provided any future hearings without explanation or notice of rescheduling.\r\n\r\nThe Court’s refusal to acknowledge or correct its misdirected contempt threats and procedural errors has created a situation of ongoing prejudice, harm, and constitutional deprivation to Movant, who remains unable to exercise custodial rights due to this unresolved matter.\r\n\r\nEach day this error is left uncorrected, it further compounds the damage to Movant’s legal position, personal stability, and most critically his relationship with the minor child.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no legal or factual justification for the continued separation of the minor child, Felix, from Movant. All previous allegations have been disproven or rendered moot, and yet no hearing is scheduled. This flagrant delay in justice and access to due process constitutes a continuing violation of Movant’s civil rights under color of state law, and may give rise to federal review or civil rights litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\r\nKelly Truelove played a critical role in validating false claims about Micheal’s housing stability during custody proceedings, despite lacking a direct rental agreement with him. Her decision to proceed with eviction efforts, combined with her refusal to clarify her communication boundaries and reliance on Jozef Hanratty’s authority, suggests possible coordination with Crycella Freitag and Josh Garrett. Given Josh Garrett's on-record statements attributing key information to Kelly, and her indirect influence on custody-related narratives, it is essential to subpoena all text message records between Kelly Truelove, Crycella Freitag, and Josh Garrett to determine the extent of collusion, perjury, or strategic misrepresentation intended to harm Micheal’s parental rights.\r\nAdditionally, the Court has failed to forward documented allegations against Jozef Hanratty to the appropriate prosecutorial authorities, despite multiple filings identifying three clear instances of perjury, committed knowingly and willfully during custody proceedings. The police previously issued a verbal warning to Mr. Hanratty regarding his involvement, yet he continued to inject himself into the litigation, materially influencing the case with demonstrable falsehoods. The Court's refusal to act or refer the matter to the District Attorney further obstructs the proper administration of justice and emboldens continued abuse of the legal process.\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant demands immediate judicial correction of the record regarding the threatened contempt, psychological evaluation and the immediate scheduling of a hearing on the outstanding motions and issues.`

    date: "2025-10-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to take immediate judicial corrective action and schedule an emergency hearing in light of ongoing violations of due process, false representations made by opposing counsel regarding third-party service providers, and the resulting deprivation of Movant’s custodial access. In support thereof, Movant states the following:\r\n\r\nI. IMMEDIATE ISSUE: USE OF NON-EXISTENT ENTITY TO OBSTRUCT REUNIFICATION\r\nThe entity referred to as \"KidCentric\" has been referenced in prior discussions related to court-ordered services or evaluations in this case.\r\nUpon investigation, there is no active or registered business operating under the name \"KidCentric\" in the State of Kansas. The only such entity was forfeited and administratively dissolved.\r\nMovant was placed in a position of relying on this non-existent provider for crucial services affecting his custodial rights, including but not limited to visitation facilitation and psychological evaluation pathways.\r\nThis constitutes material misrepresentation by opposing counsel and/or a grave procedural error by the Court, as no party should be ordered or expected to comply with an order that references a defunct or non-operational entity.\r\n\r\nII. EVALUATION PROVIDER IS REFUSING CONTACT DUE TO JOSH GARRETT\r\nThe Court additionally ordered Movant to obtain a psychological evaluation through Midtown Psychological Associates, and threatened contempt if he failed to comply.\r\nMovant made every good faith effort to schedule said evaluation; however, Midtown Psychological Associates has explicitly refused to provide services due to their refusal to work with Garrett Law Firm, who represents Respondent.\r\nThis renders the evaluation directive legally and practically impossible to comply with, through no fault of the Movant.\r\nYet, Movant remains under the implied threat of contempt and suffers continued separation from his son, Felix, without legal basis.\r\n\r\nIII. COURT’S FAILURE TO SCHEDULE A HEARING OR RULE ON MOTIONS\r\nThe Court has failed to respond to or act upon multiple properly filed and time-sensitive emergency motions submitted by the Movant, including those requesting corrections, protective orders, and judicial review of procedural errors.\r\nThe Court has also removed all scheduled hearings without rescheduling or notice, leaving the Movant in a state of procedural limbo with no avenue to be heard and removed all phone contact allowing Movant no way to contact Felix.\r\nThis denial of access to the Court, coupled with the refusal to correct directives that are impossible to comply with, has resulted in a flagrant deprivation of Movant’s due process and parental rights under both the Missouri Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\r\n\r\nIV. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MISCONDUCT BY OPPOSING COUNSEL\r\nOpposing counsel, Josh Garrett, has made repeated misrepresentations to the Court and has leveraged false narratives—including the Layne Project cancellation and \"KidCentric\" mislabeling—to paint the Movant as unstable or non-compliant.\r\nMr. Garrett knowingly omitted exculpatory evidence showing that Crycella Freitag refused to pay for court-ordered visitation at Layne Project, and later used that cancellation to push for an unjustified psychological evaluation through a provider who now refuses contact with his firm.\r\n\r\nThis conduct constitutes bad faith litigation, obstruction, and possibly fraud upon the court, warranting sanctions and referral to the appropriate disciplinary body.\r\n\r\nV. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests the following:\r\nThat the Court schedule an emergency hearing within seven (7) days to address the false representation of \"KidCentric\" and the impossibility of complying with the psychological evaluation order;\r\nThat the Court formally strike or correct any orders involving non-existent or defunct entities, and issue a revised evaluation directive through a neutral and available provider;\r\nThat the Court order immediate restoration of unsupervised parenting time until such time as lawful procedures are properly followed;\r\nThat the Court issue sanctions against Josh Garrett for misrepresentation, bad faith, and suppression of exculpatory evidence; and\r\nThat the Court provide immediate clarity regarding all outstanding motions and scheduling, so as to prevent further deprivation of Movant’s rights under color of law.`

Despite this, the Court took no action, offered no response, and allowed the issue to persist—further forcing Movant to pursue non-existent or unverifiable services, and continuing a pattern of disregard for Movant’s filings and due process rights.`

    date: "2025-9-4",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this emergency motion for judicial correction and relief, and for the immediate scheduling of a hearing regarding the inclusion of “KidCentric” as a referenced entity in this case. Movant further seeks clarification, protection, and relief against continued procedural obstruction, as this provider has now been confirmed to be unregistered, unlicensed, and uncooperative—resulting in a complete denial of access to the minor child and violation of the Movant’s constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nI. BACKGROUND AND COMMUNICATION RECORD\r\nOn April 10, 2025, Movant made a final effort to contact \"KidCentric\" after six prior failed attempts. A response was received from a personal cell phone (785-424-3700), identifying the speaker only as “Julie,” who claimed to be the director of KidCentric.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Movant asked for formal business verification, license, or legal documentation of this provider’s standing, “Julie” refused to provide any such documentation, stating, quote, “You can find what you need online. I am not providing any physical documents to you.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon being pressed for documentation or confirmation of the entity’s legitimacy, she threatened to block Movant and further stated, quote, “I will advise the court I will not be providing services for you,” without stating why or how.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic records show no registered, active business under the name “KidCentric” in Kansas, and the only such business has been forfeited. No verifiable business license, EIN, or professional affiliation has been disclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interaction is consistent with fraudulent activity, or at a minimum, an unregulated service attempting to influence judicial proceedings without accountability, documentation, or transparency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DUE PROCESS VIOLATION AND COMPLETE DENIAL OF ACCESS\r\nThe Court’s reliance on \"KidCentric\" or any affiliated actor has now resulted in a total shutdown of reunification and communication between Movant and the minor child.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, in conjunction with Midtown Psychological Associates’ refusal to coordinate with Garrett Law Firm, has rendered all court-ordered options for compliance and parenting time functionally and legally impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no court date set to resolve these critical issues, despite multiple emergency motions filed, and Movant is being denied access to his child based entirely on fabricated and unlawful third-party involvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. RELIEF REQUESTED\r\nWHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests the following:\r\nThat the Court issue an immediate order striking any reference to “KidCentric” or its alleged representatives from the record and from any future orders or considerations;\r\n\r\nThat the Court order an investigation into the nature of the service, including any statements made by “KidCentric” to the Court and whether they were initiated by or in coordination with opposing counsel;\r\n\r\nThat the Court schedule an emergency hearing within seven (7) days to review this obstruction, reset service provider arrangements through a neutral and verified party, and address the ongoing constitutional violations facing the Movant;\r\n\r\nThat opposing counsel be held accountable for presenting, supporting, or coordinating with non-licensed entities, and that sanctions be considered if the obstruction is found to be strategic or knowing;\r\n\r\nThat Movant’s access to his child be restored immediately or a pathway be established through legitimate and legally accountable channels, not fabricated or unverifiable third parties.`

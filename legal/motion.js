    status: "Pending",
    content: `EMERGENCY MOTION TO ADDRESS LACK OF STANDING PARENTING PLAN, DENIAL OF PARENTAL ACCESS, AND ONGOING JUDICIAL OBSTRUCTION
  COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon ("Movant"), and respectfully moves this Court for immediate relief, and states as follows:
  No Standing Parenting Plan Exists
   Movant currently has no legally enforceable parenting time schedule or visitation plan regarding his minor child, Felix Day Salmon.
   As of the date of this filing, there is no valid Order specifying parenting time or custodial access.
  
  
  Repeated Pleas for Intervention Ignored
   Movant has made four formal and direct requests to the Court to address:
  
  
  Allegations of child abuse.
  
  
  Active parental alienation.
  
  
  Obstruction of the child's relationship with Movant. Each time, the Court has failed to inquire further, issue directives, or initiate Guardian ad Litem intervention despite these urgent pleas.
  
  
  Denial of Access to Justice
   Movant has attempted in good faith to present critical issues to the Court for resolution.
   The Court has refused to hear or schedule these motions, citing an arbitrary hearing date of May 2nd, 2025, thereby leaving Movant with no lawful means to protect his parental rights or the child’s welfare in the interim.
  
  
  Violation of Fundamental Rights
   By failing to provide a means for Movant to see his child, failing to act upon serious allegations, and refusing to hear legitimate motions, the Court is:
  
  
  Violating Movant’s constitutional right to parent under the 14th Amendment.
  
  
  Allowing ongoing harm without judicial intervention.
  
  
  Failing its duty to safeguard the best interests of the child.
  
  
  
  WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Court:
  Immediately Restore Parental Access to Felix Day Salmon`

    id: "24SN-DR00104",
    title: "OBJECTION TO PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR CONTEMPT AND INJUNCTION",
    date: "2025-04-30",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `OBJECTION TO PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR CONTEMPT AND INJUNCTION
  COMES NOW Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and objects to Petitioner’s Motion for Contempt and Injunction on the following grounds:
  
  I. VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS
  Petitioner’s motion was filed with a simultaneous request to shorten the response window to less than 24 hours, while I am under a court-imposed filing restriction. This results in a direct denial of procedural due process under the 14th Amendment and violates the standard established in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank, 339 U.S. 306 (1950), which requires that notice be “reasonably calculated” to afford opportunity to respond.
  
  II. RETALIATION FOR PROTECTED SPEECH AND PETITION ACTIVITY
  The allegations stem directly from:
  My constitutionally protected right to petition the government for redress (BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516),
  My public disclosure of government misconduct (NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449; NY Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254),
  And my efforts to expose procedural violations through lawful class action and speech activities (NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware, 458 U.S. 886).
  This contempt motion is a thinly veiled act of retaliation, not a legitimate enforcement of court decorum.
  
  III. RECORDING WAS LEGAL UNDER KANSAS LAW AND CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED
  The recordings cited were made from Kansas, a one-party consent state (K.S.A. § 21-6101).
  No protective order was issued. No sealing of the hearing occurred.
  The court has no authority to enforce Missouri local rules extraterritorially.
  Courts have consistently upheld the right to record public officials (Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78; Fields v. City of Philadelphia, 862 F.3d 353).
  To punish me for lawful recording conducted in Kansas constitutes a conflict of laws violation and infringes upon my First Amendment rights.
  
  IV. THE COURT'S PRIOR INACTION CREATES ESTOPPEL AND BIAS
  I filed multiple emergency motions regarding parental alienation, GAL abandonment, and judicial misconduct.
  The Court has refused to hear or rule on these motions, yet now seeks to punish my response to that silence.
  The Court’s statement that it would not modify temporary custody orders “no matter what” (see Motion 14) reveals predetermined bias and violates In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133 (1955), which prohibits a judge from acting as “accuser, prosecutor, and decisionmaker.”
  
  V. NO HARM TO PETITIONER JUSTIFYING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
  Petitioner alleges embarrassment and reputational harm from lawful, public disclosures — not actual danger or obstruction of justice. Injunctive relief requires a showing of irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits (Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7). These standards are not met.
  
  VI. FUTURE ACTION NOTICE
  Any sanction imposed under these facts will be treated as:
  A retaliatory act in violation of Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250 (2006),
  A civil rights violation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1985,
  Evidence in a federal class action under Santosky v. Kramer, Troxel v. Granville, and Stanley v. Illinois.
  
  Retaliatory Use of Contempt and Unequal Enforcement of Sanctions
  Movant respectfully submits that this Court has repeatedly threatened the use of contempt and sanctions not as neutral tools of justice, but as a retaliatory mechanism in response to constitutionally protected acts, while simultaneously ignoring multiple legitimate requests for sanctions based on verified civil rights violations.
  I. Retaliation for Protected Speech and Conduct
  Movant has been threatened with contempt on three separate occasions for engaging in actions that fall squarely under the protection of the First Amendment, including:
  Publicizing court inaction and misconduct, Recording proceedings from Kansas, a one-party consent jurisdiction, Organizing and documenting proceedings via lawful online publication and class action efforts.
  None of these actions violated any lawful order or statute. Rather, they represent protected political speech, petitioning activity, and lawful evidence preservation. To threaten contempt for such acts is retaliatory and violates Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250 (2006), which prohibits punitive state action in response to protected expression.
  II. Unequal Application of Sanctions
  Movant has filed no fewer than five formal requests for sanctions or remedial action for the following:
  Guardian ad Litem abandonment of duties, Fraudulent use of fabricated instability claims by opposing witnesses, Procedural misconduct by court staff and opposing counsel, Interference with parental access without court review, Repeated violations of due process by the Court itself.
  Each of these motions was ignored or allowed to expire without hearing or explanation, in direct contradiction to the principle of equal protection under the law and the Court’s own duty to enforce compliance with its orders.
  This selective enforcement pattern establishes a double standard:
  One set of rules for a pro se parent asserting his rights, and another for licensed officers of the court engaged in procedural abuse.
  III. Legal Authority Prohibiting Selective Enforcement
  The Court’s conduct violates:
  In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133 (1955): A judge may not act as accuser and adjudicator in the same matter.
  Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972): Arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is unconstitutional.
  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886): Equal protection requires that laws be applied consistently and fairly, regardless of the individual.
  
  Pattern of Uncooperative Behavior and Refusal to Co-Parent
  I. Failure to Communicate Basic Health Information and Safety Events
  Movant submits that Respondent, Cristela Freitag, has demonstrated a sustained and deliberate refusal to engage in co-parenting communication. This refusal is not only contrary to the best interests of the child but has also resulted in unnecessary risk and harm to Felix.
  A key incident demonstrating this breakdown occurred following a supervised visitation exchange at Inspired Play Café. After returning from the visit, Felix began vomiting unexpectedly. Movant immediately reached out to Respondent to inquire about any potential cause or exposure. Respondent refused to provide any information or engage in discussion. This lack of transparency and cooperative response prompted Movant to investigate the incident independently.
  Through this investigation, Movant discovered that Respondent had taken Felix to Inspired Play Café, a facility that, upon inspection, was found to have active code violations, including:
  Improperly vented bathrooms,
  Sewer gas discharge into the play area,
  No adequate HVAC solution to mitigate airborne exposure.
  Movant notified the City of Kansas City, which inspected the facility and confirmed the violations. The city issued a citation and required immediate correction of the ventilation and air quality issues. The facility has since addressed those concerns.
  When confronted with this, Respondent stated that due to her own loss of smell, she was unaware of the hazard. However, this does not justify:
  Her refusal to inform Movant of Felix’s location,
  Her repeated choice to return to a potentially hazardous location,
  Or her complete lack of responsiveness to Movant’s health-related inquiries.
  
  
  Movant had previously submitted this incident to the Court as an example of Respondent's ongoing refusal to communicate and her failure to engage in shared parenting responsibilities. This pattern continues and poses a direct risk to Felix's well-being.
  II. Reckless Disregard for Felix’s Safety and Well-Being in Extreme Weather
  Another clear example of Respondent's failure to co-parent responsibly occurred during a visitation when she took Felix to the Kansas City Zoo during below-freezing temperatures. Despite the dangerous conditions, Respondent:
  Failed to equip Felix with proper winter clothing,
  Kept him outside for over five hours with only one break under ten minutes,
  Transported him home in an unheated car without pre-warming it,
  Delivered him back to Movant visibly shivering and physically distressed.
  
  
  Movant was forced to warm Felix immediately in a hot shower upon return and monitor him closely for illness. Over the following three days, Felix presented symptoms of cold-related sickness and discomfort. These symptoms were corroborated by:
  Movant’s parents, who noted Felix was under the weather,
  Church members, who expressed concern about Felix’s condition,
  Recorded statements and photographs, preserved and time-stamped for the record, including third-party confirmation.
  
  
  Movant immediately notified Respondent of the issue, both to express concern and to advocate for better precautions in the future. Respondent refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing or to modify her behavior. No apology, explanation, or follow-up was provided.
  This incident demonstrates:
  Negligent parenting judgment during dangerous weather,
  Total dismissal of co-parent feedback and safety advocacy,
  Reckless endangerment inconsistent with the best interests of the child.
  This behavior—when viewed in combination with earlier incidents—reflects a persistent pattern of disregard for Felix’s physical safety and refusal to co-parent or communicate, especially in matters involving health, exposure, or basic physical needs.
  III. Obstruction of Court-Ordered Communication and Refusal to Support Parent-Child Bond
  Even when the Court issued a narrow, specific allowance for Movant to have up to 30 minutes of phone time with Felix, Respondent immediately demonstrated a willful pattern of interruption, undermining, and control during those limited interactions.
  During a prior hearing, while still holding full custody, Respondent was corrected by the Court twice for:
  Interrupting Movant during a supervised phone call with Felix,
  Speaking over him in front of the judge,
  Attempting to control the content and flow of a brief, already restricted communication window.
  Despite these judicial corrections, Respondent continued to:
  Cut off or redirect conversations between Felix and Movant,
  Inject herself into the call unnecessarily or make background comments intended to manipulate or distract,
  Enforce arbitrary time restrictions or disconnection without warning, even when less than the allotted 30 minutes had been used.
  These phone calls were often the only available connection Movant had with his son, given that in-person contact has been entirely blocked due to financial obstruction and supervised visitation manipulation (addressed in other motions).
  This communication breakdown reflects:
  A deep unwillingness to support the child’s relationship with the other parent,
  A compulsive need to maintain unilateral control over Felix’s emotional and mental access, even to the point of overriding judicial boundaries.
  
  
  The Court’s own intervention during the hearing confirms that Respondent’s behavior is not based on confusion or procedural error — it is intentional and controlling. No co-parenting model can function when one parent not only withholds information and disregards health but actively sabotages even minimal lines of communication.
  PETITION FOR CUSTODIAL REDETERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AND MANDATORY JUDICIAL ACTION
  Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, respectfully petitions this Court to act decisively in the interest of the minor child, the rule of law, and the constitutional rights of all parties. Movant submits that this Court has exhausted any legitimate justification for further delay and has allowed this matter to devolve into abuse of process and retaliatory enforcement. Accordingly, Movant requests the following relief:
  I. PRIMARY CUSTODY
  That this Court:
  Immediately vacate the temporary custodial arrangement which has resulted in the unlawful and unjustified alienation of the minor child from a capable, available, and actively engaged parent;
  Grant sole legal and physical custody of Felix Day Salmon to Movant, subject to structured and court-supervised reintegration for Respondent under monitored conditions, pending review of Respondent’s psychological stability, co-parenting capacity, and willingness to comply with court orders;
  Justify said change under RSMo § 452.410, Troxel v. Granville, and the best interest of the child standard.
  
  
  
  II. CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT REFERRED TO KANSAS AUTHORITIES
  That this Court:
  Refer all evidence of fabricated tenancy statements, sworn falsehoods by opposing witnesses, interference with visitation, and fraudulent misrepresentations presented in this matter to the Kansas District Attorney and/or Kansas Department for Children and Families for appropriate investigation and prosecution under applicable law;
  Acknowledge that because Movant and minor child are both residents of Kansas, acts that originate or materially affect Movant within Kansas jurisdiction must be referred to proper authorities, not buried under Missouri’s procedural shield.
  III. SUBPOENA REQUESTS GRANTED AND ENFORCED
  That this Court:
  Immediately approve and enforce all outstanding subpoena requests previously submitted by Movant, including but not limited to:
  The Layne Project and all supervising agencies,
  All parties involved in witness fabrication or obstruction,
  Any public officer who was notified and failed to act, including GAL Brook Gipson;
  Recognize that refusal to grant subpoenas while allowing contempt proceedings creates a structural imbalance that renders fair adjudication impossible.
  IV. PERMANENT REMOTE ACCESS & PUBLIC RECORD PRESERVATION
  That this Court:
  Mandate Webex or equivalent virtual access to all future proceedings involving Movant until the conclusion of appellate and federal claims, in order to preserve due process, reduce financial obstruction, and allow for safe public recordkeeping;
  Recognize that prior attempts to eliminate Webex access amount to attempted record suppression and constitute an improper barrier to justice.
  V. MANDATORY DECISION — NO FURTHER DELAY
  That this Court:
  Issue a final ruling on custodial status, pending motions, and contempt allegations without further continuance or procedural obfuscation;
  Recognize that the current state of the case—wherein Movant is silenced, deprived of access to his child, and continuously threatened with contempt—represents not adjudication but weaponized delay;
  That this Court acknowledge Movant’s right to immediate appeal and federal civil rights action, and cease enabling a system of fraud, retaliation, and child endangerment masquerading as legal process.
  Conclusion
  Movant has exhausted every available internal mechanism, every polite form of notice, and every procedural good-faith attempt to seek justice from this Court. Further silence or inaction will be interpreted not as oversight but as complicity.`

    content: `NOTICE OF JURISDICTIONAL TERMINATION AND EVIDENTIARY PRESERVATION FOR KANSAS CUSTODY FILING
  
  Comes now Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and for the record states:
  This Court has, by deliberate inaction, procedural obstruction, and unequal access to remedy, created an environment in which justice is structurally impossible. Despite multiple filings, formal motions, and documentary evidence establishing the denial of my parental rights, this Court has:
  Failed to enforce access or communication with my child,
  
  
  Ignored five (5) motions for intervention,
  
  
  Entered threats of contempt for protected First Amendment activity,
  
  
  Allowed the opposing party to exercise de facto sole custody without adjudication,
  
  
  And appointed (2) Guardian ad Litems who have yet to be sworn in or intervene meaningfully.
  
  
  These procedural failures and ongoing constitutional violations have rendered this forum hostile and irredeemably prejudicial.
  
  Jurisdictional Statement and Termination
  I therefore terminate all participation in this proceeding, effective immediately.
  
  This termination is not a waiver, concession, or agreement with any finding or claim by the Court or opposing party. It is a direct response to the institutional failure of this Court to protect due process, parental rights, or equity under the law.
  I retain all rights to seek redress under:
  The Fourteenth Amendment,
  
  
  The Parental Rights Doctrine, and
  
  
  All applicable state and federal civil rights statutes.
  
  
  
  Evidentiary Preservation and Kansas Action
  This proceeding, including its failures, delays, and unlawful procedural posture, will be entered into the record in a new, original custody action to be filed in the State of Kansas, where the minor child has maintained primary residence for the majority of his life.
  This action shall be used as evidentiary material—not as a continuation of venue or proceeding.
  Any continued action or attempted enforcement by this Court, the Guardian ad Litem, or opposing counsel shall be construed as:
  Obstruction of Kansas jurisdiction under the UCCJEA,
  
  
  Cross-state interference with a pending custody claim, and
  
  
  Ongoing violations of civil rights and federal protections.
  
  
  
  
  
  Final Notice
  No further communication from this Court, its officers, the Guardian ad Litem, or opposing counsel will be acknowledged, unless it pertains directly to:
  Federal appellate review or
  
  
  Civil rights litigation presently in development.
  
  
  All further filings or orders in this Missouri matter will be documented and presented to the appropriate Kansas and federal authorities as evidence of extrajudicial coercion and unlawful forum manipulation.`

    title: "MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT, SANCTIONS, AND EMERGENCY TRANSFER OF CUSTODY TO WYANDOTTE COUNTY",
    date: "2025-05-05",
    type: "Motion",
    status: "Pending",
    content: `COMES NOW, Petitioner Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to enter a Default Judgment in favor of the Petitioner and against the Respondent, CRYCELLA FREITAG, and in support thereof states as follows:
  1. TOTAL OBSTRUCTION BY RESPONDENT AND OFFICERS OF THE COURT
  1.1 Respondent has failed to appear on camera in any hearings in violation of due process and transparency. Petitioner, by contrast, has been forced to show his face, posture, and emotions in every single interaction.
  1.2 Through subpoena requests and filed motions, Petitioner has shown probable cause that CRYCELLA FREITAG is being aided in real time during hearings and filings by a clandestine group consisting of:
  Trina Nudson, Carolyn Salmon, Amanda Freitag, Kate Salmon
  Ryan Weber, Mark Stephens, Chanille Witham, Jesse Salmon 2 & 3
  Kelly Truelove, Natasha Kluttz and Jozef Hanratty
  These individuals are believed to be co-conspirators facilitating concealment and providing illegal strategic guidance in violation of the rules of open and closed court.
  1.3 Subpoena requests to verify and expose this aid network were improperly denied. Had they been allowed, this Court would be in possession of screen recordings and device logs proving coordinated group interference, while Petitioner has been denied the same advantage or protection.
  2. G.A.L. MARK STEPHENS — FRAUDULENT, COERCIVE, AND EXTRA PROCEDURAL CONDUCT
  2.1 Guardian ad Litem Mark Stephens has made several demands and accusations while refusing to file formal acceptance of his appointment with the Court.
  2.2 Mr. Stephens has declared, through correspondence, that he will only formally accept the role approximately one hour before the final court date, a statement which is coercive and unprofessional, amounting to extrajudicial manipulation of court timelines.
  2.3 Mr. Stephens has made numerous factual assertions, filed informal reports, and sent communications as though operating in full capacity — all without being formally appointed. This has poisoned the proceedings and interfered with Petitioner’s right to due process and timely relief.
  3. 91+ DAYS OF WITHHELD VISITATION — CHILD ENDANGERMENT BY COURT ENABLERS
  3.1 As of the filing of this motion, Petitioner has been prohibited from seeing his son Felix for over 90 days, despite no court order explicitly barring visitation.
  3.2 Respondent has operated with impunity while this Court, and its associated actors, have refused to take action or enforce standing requests for visitation and parental access.
  3.3 Multiple motions have detailed the obstruction, and they remain unaddressed on the record. These include:
  Petitioner’s March 17, 2025 motion for subpoena and Layne Project deposition;
  Motions regarding GAL misconduct, and
  Emergency filings submitted both in Missouri and Kansas courts.
  3.4 Petitioner has since opened a Kansas case to protect his rights, which this Court continues to ignore. The refusal to acknowledge or coordinate with that jurisdiction is part of the larger withholding campaign.
  4. SYSTEMIC COERCION — DEMAND FOR ACCOUNTABILITY
  4.1 The conduct of Respondent and officers of this Court reflect growing patterns now recognized under "Criminal Coercive Control" statutes being passed in multiple U.S. jurisdictions under Senate Bill 588. These statutes criminalize ongoing manipulation, gaslighting, concealment, and social isolation tactics in domestic and custodial contexts.
  4.2 This case, and the broader class action effort emerging from it, will advocate for the immediate introduction and passage of Senate Bill 588 provisions in both Kansas and Missouri to address these escalating harms.
  4.3 As part of this effort, Petitioner demands that Joshua Garrett, attorney of record, immediately draft and file a sworn petition attesting to the full truth and verifiability of all claims, statements, and representations he has made before this Court, in writing or oral argument. This petition will serve as the basis for accountability and potential perjury claims in any subsequent proceedings or investigations.
  5. MEDIA AND TRANSPARENCY
  5.1 To prevent further gaslighting or concealment, Petitioner has uploaded all hearings, transcripts, and filings to public channels including YouTube.
  5.2 Every falsehood, omission, and contradiction is now part of the public record. The Respondent, GAL, and court actors can no longer hide behind sealed processes or selective enforcement.
  6. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
  Petitioner requests the following:
  1. That a Default Judgment be entered against CRYCELLA FREITAG for obstruction, refusal to appear, and withholding Felix;
  2. That any claims, defenses, or filings by CRYCELLA FREITAG be stricken from the record;
  3. That GAL Mark Stephens be disqualified, investigated, and barred from further involvement;
  4. That custody be temporarily and immediately transferred to Petitioner until a full and transparent hearing can be held in Wyandotte County, Kansas, which has jurisdiction based on Felix's residency;
  5. That sanctions be imposed upon any officer of the court who continued to act despite being notified of these ongoing violations;
  6. That Joshua Garrett be required to submit a sworn petition affirming all claims and representations he has made in this matter as true, complete, and verifiable under penalty of perjury.
  7. SYSTEMIC FRAUS LEGIS — THE ABUSE AND DEGRADATION OF LEGAL PROCESS
  7.1 This Court, its officers, and the Respondent have cumulatively engaged in behavior consistent with fraus legis — fraud upon the law itself — through sustained acts of misrepresentation, coercive delays, suppression of valid motions, and selective enforcement of procedural standards.
  7.2 Legal norms have been turned into tools of punishment rather than protection. Subpoenas are denied without hearing, appearances are unbalanced, and GAL appointments are enforced extra-procedurally. The effect is not mere negligence, but calculated erosion of the Petitioner's access to justice.
  7.3 Such actions do not merely affect this case — they degrade the rule of law, violating foundational principles of fairness, impartiality, and good faith.
  7.4 Petitioner asserts that unless this fraus legis is named and remedied, the system will continue to embolden actors who treat due process as theater, not as duty. The law becomes the mask worn by manipulation, rather than the safeguard against it.`

    title: "RESPONSE TO ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND MOTION TO DISMISS CONTEMPT ACTION AS RETALIATORY, UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRIOR RESTRAINT, AND DUE PROCESS VIOLATION",
    date: "2025-05-08",
    type: "Answer",
    status: "Granted",
    content: `COMES NOW Micheal Salmon, pro se, and submits this Response to the Court’s April 29, 2025, Order to Show Cause and Motion to Dismiss the contempt action in its entirety. This contempt claim is not based on any willful or unlawful defiance—but is instead a retaliatory and unconstitutional attempt to silence protected speech exposing documented due process violations and civil rights abuses that have caused irreparable harm to a parent and child.
  
  I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
  
  Respondent recorded and published segments of prior proceedings not to defy the court, but to document overwhelming violations of Missouri law, judicial canons, and constitutional protections. These proceedings involve:
  
  The removal of Respondent’s minor son, Felix, for over three months with no evidentiary finding or judicial ruling that Respondent is unfit, unsafe, or abusive.
  A systemic denial of due process and equal protection, including:
  Admitted falsification of evidence and testimony,
  The court’s refusal to enforce valid subpoenas,
  The suppression of critical exculpatory and safety-related documentation,
  Failure to apply the "best interest" or "fit parent presumption" standards required under Missouri law.
  
  As such, Respondent asserts that the court has ceased to act within the bounds of legitimate authority and now seeks to punish lawful documentation of systemic abuse and misconduct.
  
  II. THE LEGAL BASIS FOR RECORDING: NECESSITY DUE TO CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
  
  The Missouri and U.S. Constitutions provide no carve-out for courts to conceal unlawful acts. The recording was made for the following lawful and necessary purposes:
  
  To protect the rights of a minor child and expose ongoing judicial misconduct,
  To create a record for federal class action litigation involving systemic abuses of pro se litigants and the denial of fundamental parental rights,
  To preserve evidence of civil rights violations in anticipation of federal prosecution of individuals involved in obstruction, perjury, and deprivation of rights under color of law.
  
  Respondent’s conduct falls squarely under the protections of:
  
  The First Amendment, which protects the right to document and report government abuses;
  The Fourteenth Amendment, which guards against deprivation of liberty (including parenting rights) without due process of law; and
  42 U.S.C. §1983, which establishes liability for officials who violate constitutional rights under color of state authority.
  
  III. THE COURT HAS FAILED TO SHOW A LEGAL BASIS FOR CHILD REMOVAL
  
  It is undisputed that:
  
  No judicial finding of unfitness, abuse, or endangerment has ever been issued against Respondent.
  Respondent has demonstrated that the opposing party, Crycella Freitag, poses multiple documented risks, including:
  Threats of violence involving firearms,
  Coercive control and false allegations,
  Repeated violations of prior parenting orders.
  
  Despite this, the court has allowed Felix to remain deprived of access to his father in violation of Missouri’s Fit Parent Doctrine, and without meeting the state’s burden of proving that the child is in danger.
  "A natural parent has a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their child. That right is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and may not be infringed absent a showing that the parent is unfit or that the child’s welfare is otherwise endangered."
  Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000);  In re K.A.W., 133 S.W.3d 1 (Mo. banc 2004)
  
  IV. CONTEMPT CANNOT STAND WHERE THE ORDER WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND PROCEDURALLY DEFECTIVE
  
  The April 29 “order” demanding removal of the video:
  Was issued without hearing, legal basis, or statutory citation;
  Functioned as a prior restraint on protected speech;
  Sought to criminalize the exposure of publicly observable misconduct.
  
  Contempt cannot be sustained where:
  
  The underlying order was not clear, specific, or lawful;
  The Respondent was exercising a good faith belief in a higher constitutional obligation;
  The alleged violation caused no actual disruption of proceedings or prejudice to justice.
  
  V. THIS CONTEMPT ACTION IS RETALIATORY AND DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS ACCOUNTABILITY
  
  This court is now attempting to silence Respondent in anticipation of:
  An imminent federal class action lawsuit focused on judicial and clerical misconduct, obstruction, and constitutional violations;
  The exposure of collusion between court clerks, judges, and opposing parties, particularly with the use of falsified evidence and denial of access to emergency hearings for pro se litigants;
  A growing body of video and documentary evidence proving that the court selectively applies rules to shield those in power while blocking pro se parents from accessing their own children.
  
  Such actions constitute abuse of judicial authority and justify scrutiny not only in federal court, but in forthcoming media and prosecutorial inquiries.
  
  VI. VIRTUAL ACCESS, CONCEALMENT, AND JURISDICTIONAL OVERREACH
  
  Throughout these proceedings, Respondent has made every effort to participate in good faith, despite maintaining a consistent objection to this Court’s jurisdiction. Both parties reside in Kansas, and jurisdiction properly lies in Wyandotte County, where the minor child has resided the overwhelming majority of the last two years.
  
  Despite the contested nature of this forum, Respondent has cooperated fully via Webex appearances. In contrast, Crycella has used the virtual format to conceal her face, hide unauthorized participants—including Carolyn Salmon and Kelly Truelove—and create an unfair litigation advantage. The court has held Respondent to the full standard of conduct while allowing the other party to operate behind a screen of anonymity and collusion.
  
  This double standard further erodes the legitimacy of these proceedings and underscores the urgent need to terminate Missouri’s ongoing overreach and restore jurisdiction to the appropriate Kansas court.
  
  VII. CONCLUSION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF
  
  WHEREFORE, Respondent Micheal Salmon respectfully requests that this Court:
  
  DISMISS the show cause order and deny any contempt finding;
  Acknowledge that the April 29 order functioned as an unconstitutional prior restraint issued without due process;
  Refrain from further retaliatory sanctions related to Respondent’s exercise of constitutional rights;
  Take judicial notice that Respondent is preparing federal civil rights and RICO-based litigation against individuals and agencies involved in the systemic denial of justice in this matter.
  Grant full physical and sole custody of Felix Day to Micheal Salmon`
